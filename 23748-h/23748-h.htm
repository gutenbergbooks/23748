<br>
CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
THE WHIG PARTY AND ITS MISSION<br>
<br>
[1820]<br>
<br>
The term "whig" is of Scotch origin. During the bloody conflict of the<br>
Covenanters with Charles II. nearly all the country people of Scotland<br>
sided against the king. As these peasants drove into Edinburgh to<br>
market, they were observed to make great use of the word "whiggam" in<br>
talking to their horses. Abbreviated to "whig," it speedily became, and<br>
has in England and Scotland ever since remained, a name for the<br>
opponents of royal power. It was so employed in America in our<br>
Revolutionary days. Sinking out of hearing after Independence, it<br>
reappeared for fresh use when schism came in the overgrown Democratic<br>
Party.<br>
<br>
The republican predominance after 1800, so complete, bidding so fair to<br>
be permanent, drew all the more fickle Federalists speedily to that<br>
side. Since it was evident that the new party was quite as national in<br>
spirit as the ruling element of the old, the Adams Federalists, those<br>
most patriotic, least swayed in their politics by commercial motives,<br>
including Marshall, the War Federalists, and the recruits enlisted at<br>
the South during Adams's administration, also went over, in sympathy if<br>
not in name, to Republicanism. The fortunate issue of the war silenced<br>
every carper, and the ten years following have been well named the "era<br>
of good feeling."<br>
<br>
But though for long very harmonious, yet, so soon as Federalists began<br>
swelling their ranks, the Republicans ceased to be a strictly<br>
homogeneous party. Incipient schism appeared by 1812, at once announced<br>
and widened by the creation of the protective system and the new United<br>
States Bank in 1816, and the attempted launching of an internal<br>
improvements regime in 1821, all three the plain marks of federalist<br>
survival, however men might shun that name. Republicans like Clay,<br>
Calhoun in his early years, and Quincy Adams, while somewhat more<br>
obsequious to the people, as to political theory differed from old<br>
Federalists in little but name. The same is true of Clinton, candidate<br>
against Madison for the Presidency in 1812, and of many who supported<br>
him.<br>
<br>
[1825]<br>
<br>
But to drive home fatally the wedge between "democratic" and "national"<br>
Republicans, required Jackson's quarrel with Adams and Clay in 1825,<br>
when, the election being thrown into the House, although Jackson had<br>
ninety-nine electoral votes to Adams's eighty-four, Crawford's<br>
forty-one, and Clay's thirty-seven, Clay's supporters, by a "corrupt<br>
bargain," as Old Hickory alleged, voted for Adams and made him<br>
President. Hickory's idea--an untenable one--was that the House was<br>
bound to elect according to the tenor of the popular and the electoral<br>
vote. After all this, however, so potent the charm of the old party, the<br>
avowal of a purpose to build up a new one did not work well, Clay<br>
polling in 1832 hardly half the electoral vote of Adams in 1828. This<br>
democratic gain was partly owing, it is true, to Jackson's popularity,<br>
to the belief that he had been wronged in 1825, and to the widening of<br>
the franchise which had long been going on in the nation. Calhoun's<br>
election as Vice-President in 1828, by a large majority, shows that<br>
party crystallization was then far from complete. From about 1834, the<br>
new political body thus gradually evolved was regularly called the<br>
Whigs, though the name had been heard ever since 1825.<br>
<br>
[1830-1833]<br>
<br>
The doctrines characteristic of Whiggism were chiefly five:<br>
<br>
I. Broad Construction of the Constitution.<br>
<br>
This has been sufficiently explained in the chapter on Federalism and<br>
Anti-Federalism, and need not be dwelt upon. The whig attitude upon it<br>
appears in all that follows.<br>
<br>
II. The Bank.<br>
<br>
The First United States Bank had perished by the expiration of its<br>
charter in 1811. It had been very useful, indeed almost indispensable,<br>
in managing the national finances, and its decease, with the consequent<br>
financial disorder, was a most terrible drawback in the war. Recharter<br>
was, however, by a very small majority, refused. The evils flowing from<br>
this perverse step manifesting themselves day by day, a new Bank of the<br>
United States, modelled closely after the first, was chartered on April<br>
10, 1816, Clay, Calhoun, and Webster being its chief champions.<br>
Republican opponents, Madison among them, were brought around by the<br>
plea that war had proved a national bank a necessary and hence a<br>
constitutional helper of the Government in its appointed work.<br>
<br>
In the management of this second bank there were disorder and<br>
dishonesty, which greatly limited its usefulness. This, notwithstanding,<br>
was considerable. The credit of the nation was restored and its treasury<br>
resumed specie payments. But confidence in the institution was shaken.<br>
We shall see how it met with President Jackson's opposition on every<br>
possible occasion. In 1832 he vetoed a bill for the renewal of its<br>
charter, to expire in 1836, and in 1833 caused all the Government's<br>
deposits in it, amounting to ten million dollars, to be removed. These<br>
blows were fatal to the bank, though it secured a charter from<br>
Pennsylvania and existed, languishing, till 1839.<br>
<br>
III. The Tariff.<br>
<br>
Until the War of 1812 the main purpose of our tariff policy had been<br>
revenue, with protection only as an incident. During the war<br>
manufacturing became largely developed, partly through our own embargo,<br>
partly through the armed hostilities. Manufacture had grown to be an<br>
extensive interest, comparing in importance with agriculture and<br>
commerce. Therefore, in the new tariff of 1816, the old relation was<br>
reversed, protection being made the main aim and revenue the incident.<br>
It is curious to note that this first protective tariff was championed<br>
and passed by the Republicans and bitterly opposed by the Federalists<br>
and incipient Whigs. Webster argued and inveighed vehemently against it,<br>
appealing to the curse of commercial restriction and of governmental<br>
interference with trade, and to the low character of manufacturing<br>
populations.<br>
<br>
But very soon the tables were turned: the Whigs became the high-tariff<br>
party, the Democrats more and more opposing this policy in favor of a<br>
low or a revenue tariff. It should be marked that even now the idea of<br>
protection in its modern form was not the only one which went to make a<br>
high tariff popular. There were, besides, the wish to be prepared for<br>
war by the home production of war material, and also the spirit of<br>
commercial retortion, paying back in her own coin England's burdensome<br>
tax upon our exports to her shores.<br>
<br>
IV. Land.<br>
<br>
What may not improperly be styled the whig land policy sprung from the<br>
whig sentiment for large customs duties. Cheap public lands, offering<br>
each poor man a home for the taking, constantly tended to neutralize the<br>
effect of duties, by raising wages in the manufacturing sections, people<br>
needing a goodly bribe to enter mills in the East when an abundant<br>
living was theirs without money and without price on removing west. As a<br>
rule, therefore, though this question did not divide the two parties so<br>
crisply as the others, the Whigs opposed the free sale of government<br>
land, while the Democrats favored that policy. In spite of this,<br>
however, eastern people who moved westward--and they constituted the<br>
West's main population--quite commonly retained their whig politics even<br>
upon the tariff question itself.<br>
<br>
V. Internal Improvements.<br>
<br>
It has always been admitted that Congress may lay taxes to build and<br>
improve light-houses, public docks, and all such properties whereof the<br>
United States is to hold the title. The general improvement of harbors,<br>
on the other hand, the Constitution meant to leave to the States,<br>
allowing each to cover the expense by levying tonnage duties. The<br>
practice for years corresponded with this. The inland commonwealths,<br>
however, as they were admitted, justly regarded this unfair unless<br>
offset by Government's aid to them in the construction of roads, canals,<br>
and river ways.<br>
<br>

Webster's Home at Marshfield. Mass.<br>
<br>
<br>
The War of 1812 revealed the need of better means for direct<br>
communication with the remote sections of the Union. Transportation to<br>
Detroit had cost fifty cents per pound of ammunition, sixty dollars per<br>
barrel of flour. All admitted that improved internal routes were<br>
necessary. The question was whether the general Government had a right<br>
to construct them without amendment to the Constitution.<br>
<br>
The Whigs, like the old Federalists, affirmed such right, appealing to<br>
Congress's power to establish post-roads, wage war, supervise<br>
inter-state trade, and conserve the common defence and general welfare.<br>
As a rule, the Democrats, being strict constructionists, denied such<br>
right. Some of them justified outlay upon national rivers and commercial<br>
harbors under the congressional power of raising revenue and regulating<br>
commerce. Others conceded the rightfulness of subsidies to States even<br>
for bettering inland routes. Treasury surplus at times, and the many<br>
appropriations which, by common consent, had been made under Monroe and<br>
later for the old National Road, encouraged the whig contention; but the<br>
whig policy had never met general approval down to the time when the<br>
whole question was taken out of politics by the rise of the railroad<br>
system after 1832. The National Road, meantime, extending across Ohio<br>
and Indiana on its way to St. Louis, was made over in 1830 to the States<br>
through which it passed.<br>

Washington.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Whig Party deserves great praise as the especial repository, through<br>
several decades, of the spirit of nationality in our country. It<br>
cherished this, and with the utmost boldness proclaimed doctrines<br>
springing from it, at a time when the Democracy, for no other reason<br>
than that it had begun as a state rights party, foolishly combated<br>
these. Yet Whiggism was mightier in theories than in deeds, in political<br>
cunning than in statesmanship. It was far too fearful, on the whole,<br>
lest the country should not be sufficiently governed. To secure power it<br>
allied itself now with the Anti-Masons, strong after 1826 in New<br>
England, New York, and Pennsylvania; and again with the Nullifiers of<br>
South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, led by Calhoun, Troup, and<br>
White. It did the latter by making Tyler, an out-and-out Nullifier, its<br>
Vice-President in 1840.<br>
<br>
A leading Whig during nearly all his political career was John Quincy<br>
Adams, one of the ablest, most patriotic, and most successful presidents<br>
this country has ever had. He possessed a thorough education, mainly<br>
acquired abroad, where, sojourning with his distinguished father, he had<br>
enjoyed while still a youth better opportunities for diplomatic training<br>
than many of our diplomatists have known in a lifetime. He went to the<br>
United States Senate in 1803 as a Federalist. Disgusted with that party,<br>
he turned Republican, losing his place. From 1806 to 1809 he was<br>
professor in Harvard College. In the latter year Madison sent him<br>
Minister to St. Petersburg. He was commissioner at Ghent, then Minister<br>
to England, then Monroe's Secretary of State, then President.<br>

<br>
But Mr. Adams's best work was done in the House of Representatives after<br>
he was elected to that body in 1830. He sat in the House until his<br>
death, in 1848--its acknowledged leader in ability, in activity, and in<br>
debate. Friend and foe hailed him as the "Old Man Eloquent," nor were<br>
any there anxious to be pitted against him. He spoke upon almost every<br>
great national question, each time displaying general knowledge; legal<br>
lore, and keenness of analysis surpassed by no American of his or any<br>
age.<br>
<br>
Webster was, however, the great orator of the party. Reared upon a farm<br>
and educated at Dartmouth College, he went to Congress from New<br>
Hampshire as a Federalist in 1813. Removing to Boston, he soon entered<br>
Congress from Massachusetts, first as representative, then as senator,<br>
and from 1827 was in the Senate almost continuously till 1850. He was<br>
Secretary of State under Harrison and Tyler, and again in the<br>
Taylor-Fillmore cabinet from 1850.<br>

As an orator Webster had no peer in his time, nor have the years since<br>
evoked his peer. He was an influential party leader, and repeatedly<br>
thought of for President, though too prominent ever to be nominated. On<br>
two momentous questions, the tariff and slavery, he vacillated, his<br>
dubious action concerning the latter costing him his popularity in New<br>
England.<br>

<br>
<br>
Yet in many respects the most interesting figure in the party was Henry<br>
Clay. He was born amid the swamps of Hanover County, Va., and had grown<br>
up in most adverse surroundings. His father, a Baptist clergyman, died<br>
while he was an infant, leaving him destitute. In "The Slashes," as the<br>
neighborhood where Clay passed his childhood was called, he might often<br>
have been seen astride a sorry horse with a rope bridle and no saddle,<br>
carrying his bag of grain to the mill. He had attended only district<br>
schools. After obtaining the rudiments of a legal education in Richmond<br>
by service as a lawyer's clerk, he removed to Kentucky. He was soon<br>
famous as a criminal lawyer, and a little later as a politician. The<br>
rest of his life was spent in Congress or cabinet.<br>
<br>
Clay's speeches read ill, but were powerful in their delivery. He spoke<br>
directly to the heart. As he proceeded, his tall and awkward form swayed<br>
with passion. His voice was sweet and winsome. Once Tom Marshall was to<br>
face him in joint debate over a salary grab for which Clay had voted.<br>
Clay had the first word, and as he warmed to his work Marshall slunk<br>
away through the crowd in despair. "Come back," said Clay's haters to<br>
him; "you can answer every point." "Of course," replied Marshall, "but I<br>
can't get up there and do it now." The common people shouted for Clay as<br>
they shouted for neither Webster nor Adams. He had infinite fund of<br>
anecdote, remembered everyone he had ever seen, and was kindly to all.<br>
John Tyler is said to have wept when Clay failed of the Presidential<br>
nomination in the Whig Convention of 1839.<br>
<br>
[1840]<br>
<br>
Clay's vices and inconsistencies were readily forgiven. He had denounced<br>
duelling as barbarous, yet when sharp-tongued John Randolph referred to<br>
him and Adams as having, in 1825, formed "the coalition of Blifil and<br>
Black George, the combination of the Puritan and the blackleg"--for Clay<br>
gambled--Clay challenged him. They met, the diminutive Randolph being in<br>
his dressing-gown. Neither was hurt, as Randolph fired in air and Clay<br>
was no shot. Being asked why he did not kill Randolph, Clay said: "I<br>
aimed at the part of his gown where I thought he was, but when the<br>
bullet got there he had moved." In 1842, when Lord Ashburton was in<br>
Washington, there was a famous whist game, my lord, with Mr. Crittenden,<br>
playing against Clay and the Russian Minister, Count Bodisco, while<br>
Webster looked on. "What shall the stake be?" asked his lordship. "Out<br>
of deference to Her Majesty," said Clay, "we will make it a sovereign."<br>

<br>
Emphatically patriotic, super-eminent in debate, ambitious, adventurous<br>
in political diplomacy, a hard worker, incessant in activity for his<br>
party, temperate upon the slavery question, whole-souled in every<br>
measure or policy calculated to advance nationality, this versatile man<br>
may be put down as foremost among the leaders of the Whig Party from its<br>
origin till his death.<br>

CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
FLORIDA AND THE MONROE DOCTRINE<br>
<br>
[1816]<br>
<br>
It was a delicate question after the Louisiana purchase how much<br>
territory it embraced east of the Mississippi. Louisiana had under<br>
France, till 1762, reached the Perdido, Florida's western boundary at<br>
present, and was "retroceded" by Spain to France in 1800 "with the same<br>
extent that it had when France possessed it." The United States of<br>
course succeeded to whatever France thus recovered. Spain claimed still<br>
to own West Florida, the name given by Great Britain on receiving it<br>
from France in 1763 to the part of Louisiana between the Perdido and the<br>
Mississippi. Spain had never acquired the district from France, but<br>
obtained it by conquest from Great Britain during our Revolution.<br>
<br>
This claim by Spain, based only on the "retro" in the treaty of 1800,<br>
our Government viewed as fanciful, regarding West Florida undoubtedly<br>
ours through the Louisiana purchase. Spain was intractable, first of<br>
herself, later still more so through Napoleon's dictation. Hence our<br>
offer, in Jefferson's time, to avoid war, of a lump sum for the two<br>
Floridas was spurned by her. In 1810 and 1811, to save it from<br>
anarchy--also to save it from Great Britain or France, now in the<br>
whitest heat of their contest for Spain--we occupied West Florida, as<br>
certainly entitled to it against those powers, yet with no view of<br>
precluding further negotiations with Spain. When in 1812 Louisiana<br>
became a State, its eastern boundary ran as now, including a goodly<br>
portion of the region in debate.<br>
<br>
[1817]<br>
<br>
The necessity of acquiring East Florida, too, was more and more<br>
apparent. That country was without rule, full of filibusterers,<br>
privateers, hostile refugee Creeks and runaway negroes, of whose<br>
services the English had availed themselves freely during the war of<br>
1812, when Spaniards and English made Florida a perpetual base for<br>
hostile raids into our territory.&nbsp; A fort then built by the
English on<br>
the Appalachicola and left intact at the peace with some arms and<br>
ammunition, had been occupied by the negroes, who, from this retreat,<br>
menaced the peace beyond the line. Spain could not preserve law and<br>
order here. This was perhaps a sufficient excuse for the act of General<br>
Gaines in crossing into Florida and bombarding the negro fort, July 27,<br>
1816. Amelia Island, on the Florida coast, a nest of lawless men from<br>
every nation, was in 1817 also seized by the United States with the same<br>
propriety. Knowledge that Spain resented these acts encouraged the<br>
Floridians. Collisions continually occurred all along the line, finally<br>
growing into general hostility. Such was the origin of the First<br>
Seminole War.<br>

<br>
[1818]<br>
<br>
December, 1817, Jackson was placed in command in Georgia. To clear out<br>
the filibusterers, the chief source of the Indians' discontent ever<br>
since before the Creek War, the hero of New Orleans, mistakenly<br>
supposing himself to be fortified by his Government's concurrence,<br>
boldly took forcible possession of all East Florida. Ambrister and<br>
Arbuthnot, two officious English subjects found there, he put to death.<br>
<br>
This procedure was quite characteristic of Old Hickory. He acted upon<br>
the theory that by the law of nations any citizen of one land making war<br>
upon another land, the two being at peace, becomes an outlaw.<br>
International law has no such doctrine, and most likely the maxim<br>
occurred to Jackson rather as an excuse after the act than in the way of<br>
forethought. Nor was it ever proved that the two victims were guilty as<br>
Jackson alleged. With him this probably made little difference. Having<br>
undertaken to quiet the Floridian outbreaks he was determined to<br>
accomplish his end, whatever the consequences of some of his means.<br>
<br>
With the country the New Orleans victor, who had now dared to hang a<br>
British subject, was ten times a hero, but the deed confused and<br>
troubled Monroe's cabinet not a little. Calhoun wished General Jackson<br>
censured, while all his cabinet colleagues disapproved his high-handed<br>
acts and stood ready to disavow them with reparation. On this occasion<br>
Jackson owed much to one whom he subsequently hated and denounced, viz.,<br>
Quincy Adams, by whose bold and acute defence of his doubtful doings,<br>
managed with a fineness of argument and diplomacy which no then American<br>
but Adams could command, he was formally vindicated before both his own<br>
Government and the Governments of England and Spain.<br>
<br>
The posts seized had of course to be given up, yet our bold invasion had<br>
rendered Spain willing at last to sell Florida, while Great Britain,<br>
wishing our countenance in her opposition to the anti-progressive,<br>
misnamed Holy Alliance of continental monarchs, concurred. Spain after<br>
all got the better of the bargain, as we surrendered all claim to Texas,<br>
which the Louisiana purchase had really made ours.<br>
<br>
[1823]<br>
<br>
The Florida imbroglio nursed to its first public utterance a sentiment<br>
which has ever since been spontaneously taken as a principle of American<br>
public policy, almost as if it were a part of our law itself. Spain's<br>
American dependencies had been sensible enough to avail themselves of<br>
that land's distraction in Napoleon's time, to set up as states on their<br>
own account. She naturally wanted them back. Ferdinand VII. withheld<br>
till 1820 his signature of the treaty ceding Florida, in order to<br>
prevent--which, after all, it did not--our recognition of these<br>
revolted provinces as independent nations. Backed by the powerful<br>
Austrian minister, Metternich, and by the Holy Alliance, France, having<br>
aided Ferdinand to suppress at home the liberal rebellion of 1820-23,<br>
began to moot plans for subduing the new Spanish-American States. Great<br>
Britain opposed this, out of motives partly commercial, partly<br>
philanthropic, partly relating to international law, yet was unwilling<br>
so early to recognize the independence of those nations as the United<br>
States had done.<br>
<br>
Assured at least of England's moral support, President Monroe in his<br>
message of December, 1823, declared that we should consider any attempt<br>
on the part of the allied monarchs "to extend their system to any<br>
portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety," and<br>
any interposition by them to oppress the young republics or to control<br>
their destiny, "as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward<br>
the United States." This, in kernel, is the first part of Monroe's<br>
doctrine.<br>
<br>
The second part added: "The American continents, by the free and<br>
independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are<br>
henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by<br>
any European powers." The meaning of this was that the mere hap of first<br>
occupancy on the continent by the citizens of any country would not any<br>
longer be recognized by us as giving that country a title to the spot<br>
occupied.<br>
<br>
These important doctrines--for though akin in principle they are really<br>
two--were no sudden creation of individual thought, but the result<br>
rather of slow processes in the public mind. Germs of the first are<br>
traceable to Washington; express statements of both, yet not essentially<br>
detracting from Monroe's originality, to Jefferson. Both were put in<br>
form by Quincy Adams, Monroe's Secretary of State. Especially Monroe's,<br>
we believe, is the second, a resolution to which Russia's advance down<br>
the Pacific coast, and more still the recent vexations from the<br>
proximity of Spain in Florida, had pushed him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE<br>
<br>
Louisiana having become a State in 1812, that portion of the purchase<br>
north of the thirty-third degree took the name of the Missouri<br>
Territory. St. Louis was its centre of population and of influence.<br>
<br>
[1818]<br>
<br>
Being found in this extensive domain at the purchase, slavery had never<br>
been hindered in its growth. It had therefore taken firm root and was<br>
popular. The application, early in 1818, of the densest part of Missouri<br>
Territory for admission into the Union as a slave State, called<br>
attention to this threatening status of slavery beyond the Mississippi,<br>
and occasioned in Congress a prolonged, able, angry, and momentous<br>
debate. Jefferson, still alive, wrote, "The Missouri question is the<br>
most portentous which has ever threatened the Union. In the gloomiest<br>
hour of the Revolutionary War I never had apprehensions equal to those<br>
which I feel from this source."<br>
<br>
To see the bearing of the tremendous question thus raised, we have need<br>
of a retrospect. Property in man is older than history and has been<br>
nearly universal. It cannot be doubted that in an early stage of human<br>
development slavery is a means of furthering civilization. Negro slavery<br>
originated in Africa, spread to Spain before the discovery of America,<br>
to America soon after, and from the Spanish colonies to the English. The<br>
first notice we have of it in English America is that in<br>
1619 a Dutch ship landed twenty blacks at Jamestown for sale. The Dutch<br>
West India Company began importing slaves into Manhattan in 1626. There<br>
were slaves in New England by 1637. Newport was subsequently a great<br>
harbor for slavers. Georgia offered the strongest resistance to the<br>
introduction of the system, but it was soon overcome. Till about 1700,<br>
Virginia had a smaller proportion of slave population than some northern<br>
colonies, and the change later was mostly due to considerations not of<br>
morality but of profit. Anti-slavery cries were indeed heard from an<br>
early period, but they were few and faint. Penn held slaves, though<br>
ordering their emancipation at his death. Whitfield thought slavery to<br>
be of God. But its most culpable abettor was the English Government,<br>
moved by the profits of the slave trade. A Royal African Company, with<br>
the Duke of York, afterward James II., for some time its president, was<br>
formed to monopolize this business, which monarchs and ministries<br>
furthered to the utmost of their power.<br>
<br>
Thus the Revolution found slavery in all the colonies, north as well as<br>
south. But it was then, so far south as Virginia, thought to be an evil.<br>
That commonwealth had passed many laws to restrain it, but the King had<br>
commanded the Governor not to assent to any of them. The Legislature,<br>
replying, stigmatized the traffic as inhuman and a threat to the very<br>
existence of the colony. Hostility extended from the trade to slavery<br>
itself. Jefferson was for emancipation with deportation, and trembled<br>
for his country as he reflected upon the wrong of slavery and the<br>
justice of God. Patrick Henry, George Mason, Peyton Randolph,<br>
Washington, Madison, in a word all the great Virginians of the time held<br>
similar views.<br>
<br>
The Quakers of Pennsylvania were, however, the most aggressive of<br>
slavery's foes. So early as 1775 a society, the first in America if not<br>
in the world for promoting its abolition, was formed in Pennsylvania. In<br>
1789 it was incorporated, with Franklin for president. Similar<br>
organizations soon rose in several northern States, numbering among<br>
their members many of the most eminent men in the land. The British<br>
Abolition Society, formed in 1787, and the labors of Wilberforce,<br>
Clarkson, and Zachary Macaulay against the slave trade in the West<br>
Indies, had influence here, as had still more the French Assembly's bold<br>
proclamation of the Rights of Man.<br>
<br>
The Ordinance of 1787 for the Northwest Territory marked a most decisive<br>
point in the history of slavery. By its decree, in Jefferson's language,<br>
there was never to be either slavery or involuntary servitude in the<br>
said territory otherwise than in punishment for crimes. It is to the<br>
everlasting honor of the southern members then in the Continental<br>
Congress that they all voted for this inhibition. Virginia, whose assent<br>
as a State was necessary to its validity, she having at this time rights<br>
over much of the domain in question, also concurred. Whatever the<br>
strictly legal weight of this prohibition over the immense Louisiana<br>
purchase, it certainly aided much in confirming freedom as the<br>
presupposition and maxim of our law over all our national territory.<br>
<br>
Vermont had never recognized slavery save to prohibit it in its first<br>
constitution. In New Hampshire it existed but nominally. The<br>
Massachusetts constitution of 1780 virtually ended it in that State.<br>
Gradual abolition statutes passed in Pennsylvania in 1780, in Rhode<br>
Island and Connecticut in 1784. The constitution made it possible to<br>
forbid the importation of slaves in 1808. A national law to that effect<br>
was passed in 1807, making the trade illegal and affixing to it heavy<br>
penalties. The American Colonization Society was formed in 1816 for the<br>
purpose of negro deportation. It did little of this, but rendered some<br>
service toward carrying out the act against slave importation. A new law<br>
in 1820, which made this traffic piracy, punishable with death, was<br>
partly due to its influence. Also many, like Birney, Gerrit Smith and<br>
the Tappans, who began as colonizationists, subsequently became<br>
abolitionists.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding all these influences slavery increased in strength every<br>
year. South Carolina and Georgia were finding it exceedingly profitable<br>
for cotton and rice culture, and the income from slave traffic into the<br>
vast opening lands of Tennessee and Kentucky constituted an irresistible<br>
temptation. In spite of the law of 1807 and of the indescribable horrors<br>
of the business, even the foreign slave trade went on. The institution<br>
found many defenders in the Federal Convention of 1787, and in the first<br>
and subsequent Congresses. The pleas began to be raised, so current<br>
later, that the negro was an inferior being, slavery God's ordinance, a<br>
blessing to slaves and masters alike, and emancipation a folly. Now<br>
began also that policy of bravado by which, for sixty years, the friends<br>
of slavery bullied their opponents into shameful inaction upon that<br>
accursed thing politically as well as morally, which was so nearly to<br>
cost the nation its life. Thus stood matters when the Missouri<br>
Compromise was mooted in the national Legislature.<br>
<br>
We hardly need say that this strife ended in a compromise. Missouri was<br>
created a slave State, balanced by Maine as a free State, but at the<br>
same time slavery was to be excluded forever from all the remainder of<br>
the Louisiana purchase north of 36 degrees&nbsp; 30 minutes, the
southern<br>
line of Virginia and Kentucky as well as of Missouri itself. The land<br>
between Missouri and Louisiana had been in 1819 erected into the<br>
"Territory of Arkansaw."<br>
<br>
In the memorable discussion over this issue, involving the country as<br>
well as Congress, two sorts of argumentation were heard in favor of the<br>
suit of Missouri. The genuine pro-slavery men urged the sacredness of<br>
property as such, and the special sacredness of property-right in slaves<br>
as tacitly guaranteed by the Constitution. They also made much of the<br>
third article of the Louisiana purchase treaty. This read as follows:<br>
"The inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the<br>
Union of the United States and admitted as soon as possible, according<br>
to the principles of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all<br>
the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States;<br>
and in the meantime they shall be maintained and protected in the free<br>
enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the religion which they<br>
profess."<br>
<br>
There were with these, men who acted from mere policy, thinking it best<br>
to admit the slave State because of the difficulty and also the danger<br>
to the Union of suppressing slavery there. They appealed as well to the<br>
sacred compromises in the Constitution, meaning the permission at first<br>
to import slaves, the three-fifths rule for slave representation in<br>
Congress, and the fugitive slave clause. They spoke much of the<br>
necessity of preserving the balance of power within the Union, and of<br>
Congress's inaction as to slavery in the Louisiana purchase hitherto,<br>
and also in Florida. These arguments won many professed foes of slavery,<br>
as Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and Quincy Adams. In all Congress Clay was<br>
the most earnest pleader for the compromise.<br>
<br>
To all these arguments the unbending friends of free soil replied that<br>
property right was subordinate to the national good, and that Congress<br>
had full power over territorial institutions and should never have<br>
permitted slavery to curse the domain in question. If it had committed<br>
error in the past, that could not excuse continuance in error. The terms<br>
of the Louisiana purchase, it was further urged, could not, even if they<br>
had been meant to do so, which was not true, detract from this sovereign<br>
power. It was pointed out that in every case in which a State had been<br>
admitted thus far, Congress had prescribed conditions. It was boldly<br>
said, still further, that if slavery threatened disunion unless allowed<br>
its way, it ought all the more to be denied its way.<br>
<br>
The chief strength of slavery in this crisis lay in the distressing<br>
practical difficulty, if the prayer of Missouri were refused, of dealing<br>
with slaves and slave proprietorship there, and of quieting a numerous<br>
and spirited population bent upon statehood and slavery together. The<br>
more decided foes of slavery did not sufficiently consider these<br>
complications. Nor did they duly reflect upon the sweeping triumph which<br>
freedom had withal secured in the pledge that the vast bulk of the<br>
Louisiana purchase should be forever free. The pledge was indeed broken<br>
in 1854, but not until such a sense of its sacredness had been impressed<br>
upon the country that the breach availed slavery nothing.<br>

CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
THE GREAT NULLIFICATION<br>
<br>
[1816-1828]<br>
<br>
The tariff rates of 1816 on cottons and woollens were to be twenty-five<br>
per cent. for three years, after that twenty. Instead of this the cotton<br>
tariff was in 1824 replaced at twenty-five per cent., the same as that<br>
upon woollens costing thirty-three and a third cents or less per square<br>
yard; woollens over this price bearing thirty per cent. Wool, which by<br>
the tariff of 1816 was free, now bore, some grades fifteen, some twenty,<br>
some thirty per cent. Iron duties were put up in 1818 and again in 1824,<br>
from which date for ten years they ranged between forty and one hundred<br>
per cent. The whole tendency of tariff rates was strongly upward. The<br>
duty upon all dutiables averaged between 1816 and 1824 only twenty-four<br>
and a half per cent; from 1824 to 1828 the average was thirty-two and a<br>
half per cent. Importation remained copious, notwithstanding, which made<br>
the cry for protection louder than ever.<br>
<br>
[1828]<br>
<br>
From Quincy Adams's presidency the tariff question becomes on the one<br>
hand political, dividing Whigs from Democrats about exactly, which had<br>
never been the case before, and on the other, sectional, the West, the<br>
Centre, and now also the East, pitted against the solid South, except<br>
Louisiana. The year 1824 heard Webster's last speech for free trade and<br>
saw Calhoun's and Jackson's last vote for protection. However, so strong<br>
was the protectionist sentiment in the XXth Congress, though democratic,<br>
that free-traders could hope to defeat the new tariff bill of 1828 only<br>
by rendering it odious to New England. They therefore conspired to make<br>
prohibitive its rates for Smyrna wool, and nearly so those on iron,<br>
hemp, and cordage for ship-building; also on molasses, the raw material<br>
for rum, whereon no drawback was longer to be allowed if it was<br>
exported.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 448px; height: 582px;" alt="" src="images/065Pic.jpg"><br>

<br>
<br>
The Whigs had arranged, to be now passed, a series of minimum rates on<br>
woollens, by which all costing over fifty cents a square yard were to<br>
pay as if costing $2.50, and all over this as if costing $4.00. The rate<br>
was to be forty per cent. the first year, forty-five the second, and<br>
fifty thereafter.<br>
<br>
This illustrates the famous "minimum principle," which has played such a<br>
figure in all our tariff history since 1816, its effect being always to<br>
make the tariff much higher than it seems. Thus in the case before us,<br>
most of the woollens then imported cost about ninety cents. If based on<br>
this price, the tariff would be thirty-six per cent., but if based on<br>
$2.50 as the price, it would mount up to one hundred and ten per cent.<br>
To prevent this and to render the bill still more unpalatable to the<br>
Whigs, the Democrats introduced a dollar "minimum," so that the tariff<br>
on the bulk of our imported woollens, costing, as just stated, about<br>
ninety cents, would come in at forty-four and four-tenths per cent.<br>
<br>
But as this was after all more vigorous protection than woollens had<br>
before received, amounting, through minima, in some cases to over one<br>
hundred per cent., sixteen out of the thirty-nine New England members,<br>
led by Webster, accepted this universally odious tariff bill--the Tariff<br>
of Abominations, it was called--as the preferable evil, and, aided by a<br>
few Democrats in each house, made it a law. The average duty on<br>
dutiables was now about forty-three and a third per cent.<br>
<br>
No one can question that this high tariff worked injustice to the South.<br>
It forced from her an undue share of the national taxes, as well as<br>
extensive tribute to northern manufacturers. But in resenting the evil<br>
she exaggerated it, mistakenly referring all the relative decrease in<br>
her prosperity to tariff legislation, when a great part of it was due<br>
simply to slavery. The South complained that selfishness and political<br>
ambition, not patriotism or reason, determined the dominant policy, and<br>
there was of course some truth in this. Moreover, as New England now<br>
favored it, this policy bade fair to become permanent, and since the<br>
tariff bills did not announce protection as their purpose, the<br>
constitutionality of them could not be gotten before the courts.<br>
<br>
[1830]<br>
<br>
Nearly all the southern Legislatures consequently denounced the tariff<br>
as unjust and as hostile to our fundamental law. Most of them were,<br>
however, prudent enough to suggest no illegal remedies. Not so with<br>
fiery South Carolina, where a large party, inspired by Calhoun, proposed<br>
a bold nullification of the tariff act, virtually amounting to<br>
secession. At a dinner in this interest at Washington, April 13, 1830,<br>
Calhoun offered the toast: "The Union; next to our liberty the most<br>
dear; only to be preserved by respecting the rights of the States."<br>
<br>
[1832]<br>
<br>
John C. Calhoun was now, except, perhaps, Clay, the ablest and most<br>
influential politician in all the South. Born in South Carolina in 1782,<br>
of Irish-Presbyterian parentage, though poor and in youth ill-educated<br>
like Clay and Jackson, his energy carried him through Yale College, and<br>
through a course of legal study at Litchfield, Conn., where stood the<br>
only law school then in America. November, 1811, found him a member of<br>
Congress, on fire for war with Britain. Monroe's Secretary of War for<br>
seven years from 1817, he was in 1825 elected Vice-President, and<br>
reelected in 1828. He had meantime turned an ardent free-trader, and<br>
seeing the North's predominance in the Union steadily increasing, had<br>
built up a nullification theory based upon that of the Virginia and<br>
Kentucky resolutions and the Hartford Convention, and upon the history<br>
of the formation of our Constitution. He had worked out to his own<br>
satisfaction the untenable view that each State had the right, not in<br>
the way of revolution but under the Constitution itself--as a contract<br>
between parties that had no superior referee--to veto national laws upon<br>
its own judgment of their unconstitutionality.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
On this doctrine South Carolina presently proceeded to act. November 24,<br>
1832, the convention of that State passed its nullification ordinance,<br>
declaring the tariff acts of 1828 and 1832 "null, void, and no law,"<br>
defying Congress to execute them there, and agreeing, upon the first use<br>
of force for this purpose, to form a separate government.<br>
<br>
This was the quintessence of folly even had good theory been behind it.<br>
The tone of the proceeding was too hasty and peremptory. The decided<br>
turn of public opinion and of congressional action in favor of large<br>
reduction in duties was ignored. But the theory appealed to was clearly<br>
wrong, and along with its advocates was sure to be reprobated by the<br>
nation. A precious opportunity effectively to redress the evil<br>
complained of was wantonly thrown away. Worst of all, from a tactical<br>
point of view, South Carolina had miscalculated the spirit of President<br>
Jackson. At the dinner referred to, his toast had been the memorable<br>
words: "Our Federal Union; it must be preserved." Men now saw that Old<br>
Hickory was in earnest. General Scott, with troops and warships, was<br>
ordered to Charleston.<br>
<br>
The nullifiers receded, a course made easier by Clay's "compromise<br>
tariff" of&nbsp; 1833, gradually reducing duties for the next ten
years, and<br>
enlarging the free list. From all duties of over twenty per cent. by the<br>
act of 1832, one-tenth of the excess was to be stricken off on September<br>
30, 1835, and another tenth every other year till 1841. Then one-half<br>
the excess remaining was to fall, and in 1842 the rest, so that the end<br>
of the last named year should find no duty over twenty per cent.<br>
<br>
This episode, threatening as it was for a time, drew in its train<br>
results the most happy, revealing with unprecedented vividness to most,<br>
both the original nature of the Constitution as not a compact, and also<br>
the might which national sentiment had attained since the War of 1812.<br>
The doctrine of state rights was seen to have gradually lost, over the<br>
greater part of the country, all its old vitality. Nearly every State<br>
Legislature condemned the South Carolina pretensions, Democrats as<br>
hearty in this as Whigs. Jackson's proclamation against them--impressive<br>
and unanswerable--ran thus: "The Constitution of the United States<br>
forms a government, not a league; and whether it be formed by compact<br>
between the States, or in any other manner, its character is the same<br>
. . . . I consider the power to annul a law of the United States<br>
incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by<br>
the letter of the Constitution, and destructive of the great object for<br>
which it was formed. . . . Our Constitution does not contain the<br>
absurdity of giving power to make laws, and another power to resist<br>
them. To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to<br>
say that the United States are not a nation."<br>

Calhoun's Library and Office.<br>
<br>
<br>
The congressional debates which the nullification question evoked, among<br>
the ablest in our parliamentary history, held the like high national<br>
tenor. Calhoun's idea, though advocated by him with consummate skill,<br>
was shown to be wholly chimerical. The doughty South Carolinian, from<br>
this moment a waning force in American politics, was supported by Hayne<br>
almost alone, the arguments of both melting into air before Webster's<br>
masterful handling of constitutional history and law. Not questioning<br>
the right of revolution, admitting the general government to be one of<br>
"strictly limited," even of "enumerated, specified, and particularized<br>
powers," the Massachusetts orator made it convincingly apparent that the<br>
Calhoun programme could lead to nothing but anarchy. It was seen that<br>
general and state governments emanate from the people with equal<br>
immediacy, and that the language of the clause, "the Constitution and<br>
the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof" are "the<br>
supreme law of the land, anything in the constitution or laws of any<br>
State to the contrary notwithstanding," means precisely what it says. To<br>
this language little attention had apparently been paid till this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
MINOR PUBLIC QUESTIONS OF JACKSON'S "REIGN"<br>
<br>
[1828]<br>
<br>
Andrew Jackson was born March 15, 1767. His parents had come from<br>
Carrick-fergus, Ireland, two years before. He was without any education<br>
worthy the name. As a boy, he went into the War for Independence, and<br>
was for a time a British prisoner. He studied law in North Carolina,<br>
moved west, and began legal practice at Nashville. He was one of the<br>
framers of the Tennessee constitution in 1796. In 1797 he was a senator<br>
from that State, and subsequently he was a judge on its supreme bench.<br>
His exploits in the Creek War, the War of 1812, and the Seminole War are<br>
already familiar. They had brought him so prominently and favorably<br>
before the country that in 1824 his vote, both popular and electoral,<br>
was larger than that of any other candidate. As we have seen, he himself<br>
and multitudes throughout the country thought him wronged by the<br>
election over him of John Quincy Adams. This contributed largely to his<br>
popularity later, and in 1828 he was elected by a popular vote of<br>
647,231, against 509,097 for Adams. Four years later he was reelected<br>
against Clay by a still larger majority. Nor did his popularity to any<br>
extent wane during his double administration, notwithstanding his many<br>
violent and indiscreet acts as President.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 450px; height: 582px;" alt="" src="images/079Pic.jpg"><br>

<br>
<br>
Much of Jackson's arbitrariness sprung from a foolish whim of his,<br>
taking his election as equivalent to the enactment of all his peculiar<br>
ideas into law. Ours is a government of the people, he said; the people<br>
had spoken in his election, and had willed so and so. Woe to any senator<br>
or representative who opposed! This was, of course, to mistake entirely<br>
the nature of constitutional government.<br>
<br>
After all, Jackson was by no means the ignorant and passionate old man,<br>
controlled in everything by Van Buren, that many people, especially in<br>
New England, have been accustomed to think him. Illiterate he certainly<br>
was, though Adams exaggerated in calling him "a barbarian who could not<br>
write a sentence of grammar and could hardly spell his own name." He was<br>
never popular in the federalist section of the Union. Yet with all his<br>
mistakes and self-will, often inexcusable, he was one of the most<br>
patriotic and clear-headed men who ever administered a government. If he<br>
resorted to unheard-of methods within the law, very careful was he never<br>
to transgress the law.<br>
<br>
The most just criticism of Jackson in his time and later related to the<br>
civil service. It was during his administration that the cry, "turn the<br>
rascals out," first arose, and it is well known that, adopting the<br>
policy of New York and Pennsylvania politicians in vogue since 1800, he<br>
made nearly a clean sweep of his political opponents from the offices at<br>
his disposal. This was the more shameful from being so in contrast with<br>
the policy of preceding presidents. Washington removed but two men from<br>
office, one of these a defaulter; Adams ten, one of these also a<br>
defaulter; Jefferson but thirty-nine; Madison five, three of them<br>
defaulters; and Monroe nine. The younger Adams removed but two, both of<br>
them for cause.<br>
<br>
[1830]<br>
<br>
Yet of Jackson's procedure in this matter it can be said, in partial<br>
excuse, so bitter had been the opposition to him by officeholders as<br>
well as others, that many removals were undoubtedly indispensable in<br>
order to the efficiency of the public service. It is not at all<br>
necessary for the rank and file of the civil service to be of the same<br>
party with the Chief Magistrate, but it is necessary that they should<br>
not be so utterly opposed to him as to feel bound in conscience to be<br>
working for his defeat.<br>
<br>
The fine art of party organization, semi-military in form, has come to<br>
us from Jackson and his workers. Before his time, candidates for high<br>
state offices had usually been nominated by legislative caucuses, and<br>
those for national posts by congressional caucuses. State party<br>
conventions had been held in Pennsylvania and New York. Soon after 1830<br>
such a device for national nominations began to be thought of, and the<br>
history of national party conventions may be said to begin with the<br>
campaign of 1832.<br>
<br>
[1832]<br>
<br>
Jackson's dearest foe while in office was the United States Bank.<br>
Magnifying the dishonesty which had, as everyone knew, disgraced its<br>
management, he attacked it as a monster, an engine of the moneyed<br>
classes for grinding the face of the poor. Like Jefferson, like Madison<br>
at first, he disbelieved in its constitutionality. In his first message<br>
and continually in his official utterances he inveighed against it as a<br>
public danger, using its funds and patronage for party ends. This made<br>
him unpopular with many who had been his friends, so that in the<br>
campaign of 1832 Clay forced the bank question to the front as one on<br>
which Jackson's attitude would greatly advantage the whig cause. He<br>
accepted Clay's challenge with pleasure, and from this moment gave the<br>
bank no quarter. We may call the contest of this year a pitched battle<br>
between Jackson and the bank.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 309px; height: 448px;" alt=""

Roger B. Taney.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1833]<br>
<br>
In 1832 he vetoed a bill for a renewal of its charter, which was to<br>
expire in 1836, and in 1833 he proceeded to break it by removing the<br>
United States deposits which it held. Such removal was by law within the<br>
power of the Secretary of the Treasury. Secretary McLane refused to<br>
execute Jackson's will. He was removed and Duane appointed. Then Duane<br>
was removed and Roger B. Taney appointed, who obeyed the President's<br>
behest. The bank was emptied by checking out the public money as wanted,<br>
at the same time depositing no more, the funds being instead placed in<br>
"pet" state banks, as they were called because of the government favor<br>
thus shown them.<br>
<br>
The financial distress rightly or wrongly ascribed to this measure<br>
throughout the country, instead of injuring Jackson, probably, on the<br>
whole, made him still more popular, as showing the power of the bank.<br>
When Congress met in 1833, the Senate passed a vote of censure upon him<br>
for what he had done. Rancorous wranglings and debates pervaded Congress<br>
and the whole land. After persistent effort by Jackson's bosom friend,<br>
Senator Benton, of Missouri, this censure-vote was expunged by the<br>
XXIVth Congress, second session, January 16, 1837. This was before<br>
Jackson left office, and he accounted it the greatest triumph of his<br>
public life.<br>
<br>
[1830]<br>
<br>
<br>
Jackson was somehow fortunate in dealing with foreign nations. It was he<br>
who recovered for American ships that British West Indian trade which<br>
had been so long denied. Negotiations were opened with Great Britain,<br>
which, in 1830, had the result of placing American vessels in the<br>
British West Indian ports at an equal advantage with British vessels<br>
sailing thither from the United States--terms which, through the<br>
contiguity of those islands to us, gave us a trade there better than<br>
that of any other nation. This diplomacy brought the administration much<br>
applause.<br>
<br>
When Jackson became President, France was still in our debt on account<br>
of her spoliations upon American commerce after the settlement of 1803.<br>
The matter had been in negotiation ever since 1815, but hitherto in<br>
vain. Jackson took it up with zeal, but with his usual apparent<br>
recklessness. A treaty had been concluded in 1831, as a final settlement<br>
between the two countries, binding France to pay twenty-five million<br>
francs and the United States to pay one and one-half million. The first<br>
instalment from France became due February 2, 1833, but was not paid.<br>
Jackson's message to Congress in 1834, not an instalment having yet been<br>
received, contained a distinct threat of war should not payment begin<br>
forthwith. He also bade Edward Livingston, minister at Paris, in the<br>
same contingency to demand his passports and leave Paris for London.<br>
<br>
[1835]<br>
<br>
Most public men, even those in his cabinet, thought this action<br>
foolhardy and useless; but Quincy Adams, neither expecting nor receiving<br>
any thanks for it, just as in the Seminole War difficulty, nobly stood<br>
up for the President. A telling speech by him in the House led to its<br>
unanimous resolution, March 2, 1835, that the execution of the treaty<br>
should be insisted on. The French ministry blustered, and for a time<br>
diplomatic relations between the two countries were entirely ruptured.<br>
But France, affecting to see in the message of 1835, though voiced in<br>
precisely the same tone as its predecessor, some apology for the menace<br>
contained in that, began its payments. This money, as also all due from<br>
the other states included in Napoleon's continental system, was paid<br>
during Jackson's administration, a result which brought him and his<br>
party great praise, not more for the money than for the respect and<br>
consideration secured to the United States by insistence upon its<br>
rights. The President's message to Congress in 1835 announced the entire<br>
extinguishment of the public debt--the first and the last time this has<br>
occurred in all our national history.<br>
<br>
An important measure touching the hard-money system of our country was<br>
passed in large part through the influence of President Jackson. By the<br>
Mint Law of 1792 our silver dollar was made to contain three hundred and<br>
seventy-one and a quarter grains of fine silver, or four hundred and<br>
sixteen of standard silver. The amount of pure silver in this venerable<br>
coin has remained unchanged ever since; only, in 1837, by a reduction of<br>
the alloy fraction to exactly one-tenth, the total weight of the coin<br>
became what it now is, four hundred and twelve and a half grains,<br>
nine-tenths fine. The same law of 1792 had given the gold dollar just<br>
one-fifteenth the weight of the silver dollar. This proportion, which<br>
Hamilton had arrived at after careful investigation characteristic of<br>
the man, was exactly correct at the time, but within a year, as is now<br>
known, on account of increase in the relative value of gold, the gold<br>
dollar at fifteen to one became more valuable than its silver mate. The<br>
consequence was that the gold brought to the United States mint for<br>
coinage fell off year by year, until some of the years between 1820 and<br>
1830 it had been almost zero. Gold money had nearly ceased to circulate.<br>
<br>
[1834-1836]<br>
<br>
Jackson resolved to restore the yellow metal to daily use. In this he<br>
was opposed by many Whigs, who, so zealous were they for the United<br>
States Bank, had become paper money men. The so-called Gold Bill was<br>
carried through Congress in 1834, changing the proportion of silver to<br>
gold in our currency from fifteen to one to sixteen to one. It should<br>
have been fifteen and a half to one. Now gold in its turn was<br>
over-valued, so that silver gradually ceased to circulate, as gold had<br>
almost ceased before. This result was made worse after 1848, when there<br>
was a still further appreciation of silver through the discovery of gold<br>
in California and Australia. Silver dollars did not again circulate<br>
freely in the country until 1878, though they were full legal tender<br>
till 1873. Gold, on the other hand, was everywhere seen after 1834,<br>
though not abundant in circulation, owing to the large amounts of paper<br>
money then in use.<br>
<br>
In 1836 the President ordered his Secretary of the Treasury to put forth<br>
the famous Specie Circular, declaring that only gold, silver, or land<br>
scrip should be received in payment for public lands. The occasion of<br>
this was that while land sales were very rapidly increasing, the<br>
receipts hitherto had consisted largely in the notes of insolvent banks.<br>
Land speculators would organize a bank, procure for it, if they could,<br>
the favor of being a "pet" bank, issue notes, borrow these as<br>
individuals and buy land with them. The notes were deposited, when they<br>
would borrow them again to buy land with, and so on. As there was little<br>
specie in the West, the circular broke up many a fine plan, and evoked<br>
much ill-feeling. Gold was drawn from the East, where, as many of the<br>
banks had none too much, the drain caused not a few of them to collapse.<br>
The condition of business at this time was generally unsound, and this<br>
westward movement of gold was all that was needed to precipitate a<br>
crisis. A crisis accordingly came on soon after, painfully severe. It is<br>
unfair, however, to arraign Jackson's order as wholly responsible for<br>
the evils which accompanied this monetary cataclysm. It was rather an<br>
occasion than the cause.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
THE FIRST WHIG TRIUMPH<br>
<br>
[1837]<br>
<br>
Partly Jackson's personal influence, partly his able aides, partly<br>
favoring circumstances had, during his administrations, brought the<br>
Democracy into excellent condition, patriotic, national in general<br>
spirit, with a creed that, however imperfect--close construction being<br>
its integrating idea--was, after all, definite, consistent, and<br>
thoughtful. Yet in 1840 the Democrats, who four years before had chosen<br>
Van Buren by an electoral vote of 170 to 73, had to surrender, with the<br>
same Van Buren for candidate, to the Whigs by a majority of 234<br>
electoral votes to 60; only five States, and but two of them northern,<br>
going for the democratic candidate.<br>
<br>
There were several causes for this defeat. Jackson had made many enemies<br>
as well as many friends, some of these within his own party, while the<br>
entire opposition to him was indescribably bitter on account of the<br>
personal element entering into the struggle. The commendably national<br>
spirit of the Whig Party told well in its favor. Upon this point its<br>
attitude proved far more in accord with the best sentiment of the nation<br>
than that of the Democracy, sound as the latter was at the core and<br>
nobly as its chief had behaved in the nullification crisis.<br>
<br>
More influential still was the financial predicament into which on<br>
Jackson's retirement his successor and the country were plunged. The<br>
commercial distress which seemed to spring from Jackson's measures was<br>
now first fully realized. Anger and pain from the death of the bank had<br>
not abated. Ardent hatred prevailed toward the "pet" banks, extending to<br>
the party whose darlings they were, while the Specie Circular was held<br>
to have ruined most of the others. The subsequent legislation for<br>
distributing the treasury surplus among the States, by removing the<br>
deposits from the pet banks, destroyed many of these as well. They had<br>
been using this government money for the discount of loans to business<br>
men, and were not in condition instantly to pay it back. Hence the panic<br>
of 1837. First the New York City banks suspended, soon followed by the<br>
others throughout that State, all sustained in their course by an act of<br>
the Legislature. Suspension presently occurred everywhere else. The<br>
financial pressure continued through the entire summer of 1837, banks,<br>
corporations, and business men going to the wall, and all values greatly<br>
sinking. Boston suffered one hundred and sixty-eight business failures<br>
in six months.<br>

Martin Van Buren.<br>

<br>
<br>
One of Van Buren's earliest acts after assuming office was to call an<br>
extra session of Congress for September 4, 1837, to consider the<br>
financial condition of the country. When it convened, an increase of the<br>
whig vote was apparent, though the Democrats were still in the majority.<br>
On the President's recommendation, agitation now began in favor of the<br>
sub-treasury or independent treasury plan, still in use to-day, of<br>
keeping the government moneys. This had been first broached in 1834-35<br>
by Whigs. The Democrats then opposed it; but now they took it up as a<br>
means of counteracting the whig purpose to revive a national bank.<br>
<br>
There was soon less need of any such special arrangement, as the<br>
treasury was swiftly running dry. In June of the preceding year, 1836,<br>
both parties concurring, an act had passed providing that after January<br>
1, 1837, all surplus revenue should be distributed to the States in<br>
proportion to their electoral votes. It was meant to be a loan, to be<br>
recalled, however, only by vote of Congress, but it proved a donation.<br>
Twenty-eight millions were thus paid in all, never to return. Such a<br>
disposition of the revenue had now to be stopped and reverse action<br>
instituted. Importers called for time on their revenue bonds, which had<br>
to be allowed, and this checked income. This special session was needed<br>
to authorize an issue of ten millions in treasury notes to tide the<br>
Government over the crisis.<br>
<br>
[1840]<br>
<br>
Another influence which now worked powerfully against the Democracy was<br>
hostility to slavery. This campaign--it was the first--saw a "Liberty<br>
Party" in the field, with its own candidates, Birney and Earle. The<br>
abolition sentiment, of which more will be said in a subsequent chapter,<br>
was growing day by day, and little as the Whigs could be called an<br>
antislavery party on the whole, their rank and file were very much more<br>
of that mind than those of the opposition. Jackson had ranted wildly<br>
against the despatch of abolition literature through the mails. The<br>
second Seminole War, 1835-42, was waged mainly in deference to<br>
slave-holders, to recover for them their Florida runaways, and, by<br>
removal of the Seminoles beyond the Mississippi, to break up a popular<br>
resort for escaped negroes.&nbsp; The Indians, under Osceola, whose
wife, as<br>
daughter to a slave-mother, had been treacherously carried back into<br>
bondage, fought like tigers. After their massacre of Major Dade and his<br>
detachment, Generals Gaines, Jesup, Taylor, Armistead, and Worth<br>
successively marched against them, none but the last-named successful in<br>
subduing them. Over 500 persons had been restored to slavery, each one<br>
costing the Government, as was estimated, at least $80,000 and the lives<br>
of three white soldiers.<br>

[1839]<br>
<br>
Van Buren was to the slavocrats even more obsequious than Jackson. His<br>
spirit was shown, among other things, by the Amistad case, in 1839. The<br>
schooner Amistad was sailing between Havana and Puerto Principe with a<br>
cargo of negroes kidnapped in Africa. Under the lead of a bright negro<br>
named Cinque the captives revolted and killed or confined all the crew<br>
but two, whom they commanded to steer the ship for Africa. Instead,<br>
these directed her to the United States coast, where she was seized off<br>
Long Island by a war vessel and brought into New London. The negroes<br>
were, even by Spanish law, not slaves but free men, as Spain had<br>
prohibited the slave trade. Yet when their case was tried before the<br>
district court, Mr. Van Buren spared no effort to procure their release<br>
to the Spanish claimants. He even had a government vessel all ready to<br>
convey the poor victims back to Cuba. The district court having decided<br>
for the blacks, the government attorney appealed to the circuit court,<br>
thence also to the supreme court.&nbsp; Final judgment happily
re-affirmed<br>
that the men were free. The supreme court trial was the occasion of one<br>
of John Quincy Adams's most splendid forensic victories, he being the<br>
counsel for the negroes.<br>
<br>
The attitude of the administration in this affair greatly injured the<br>
party in the North, the more as it but illustrated a spirit and policy<br>
which had grown characteristic of the party's head. In several instances<br>
previous to this time, when ships conveying slaves from one of the<br>
United States to another, entered the ports of the Bahama Islands<br>
through stress of weather, England had, while freeing them, allowed some<br>
compensation. Now, having emancipated the slaves in her own West Indian<br>
possessions, she declined longer to continue that practice. Her first<br>
refusal touched the slaves on the ship Enterprise, which had put in at<br>
Port Hamilton in 1835. Jackson's administration in vain sought<br>
indemnity, Van Buren, then Secretary of State, designating this business<br>
as "the most immediately pressing" before the English embassy.<br>
<br>
[1840]<br>
<br>
In the same pro-slavery interest an increasing proportion of the<br>
Democracy, though not Van Buren himself, had come to favor the<br>
annexation of Texas. The southwestern boundary of the United States had<br>
ever since the purchase in Florida in 1819 been recognized as the Sabine<br>
River, west of this lying the then foreign country of Texas. France had<br>
claimed the Rio Grande as Louisiana's western bound, but Mr. Monroe, to<br>
placate the North in the Florida annexation, had receded from this<br>
claim. Texas and Coahuila became a state in the new Mexican republic,<br>
which Spain recognized in 1821; but in 1836 Texas declared itself<br>
independent. It was ill-governed and weighed down with debt, and hence<br>
almost immediately, in 1837, asked membership in the American Union. Its<br>
annexation was bitterly opposed all over the North, so bitterly in fact<br>
that the northern Democrats would not have dared, even had they wished,<br>
to favor the scheme. Yet so strong was the southern influence in the<br>
party by 1840 that the democratic platform that year urged the<br>
"re-annexation" of Texas, the term assuming that as a part of Louisiana<br>
it had always been ours since 1803. This was a fact, but it was now<br>
asseverated by the Democracy for a selfish sectional purpose, and the<br>
cry brought thousands of votes to the Whigs.<br>
<br>
It proved good politics for the Whigs in 1840 to pass over Clay and<br>
adopt as their candidate William Henry Harrison. He had indeed been<br>
unsuccessful in 1836, owing to the great popularity of Jackson, all<br>
whose influence went for Van Buren; but now that "Little Van," or<br>
"Matty," as Jackson used to call him, stood alone, Harrison had a better<br>
chance. His political record had been inconspicuous but honorable.<br>
Nothing could be alleged against his character. He was a gentleman of<br>
some ability, while his brilliant military record in 1812, now revived<br>
to the minutest detail, gave him immense popularity. Every surviving<br>
Tippecanoe or Thames veteran stumped his vicinity for the old war-horse.<br>
Many wavering Democrats in the South, especially those of the<br>
nullification stripe, were toled to the whig ticket by the nomination of<br>
John Tyler for Vice-President. "Tippecanoe and Tyler too" rang through<br>
the land as the whig watchword for the campaign. During the<br>
electioneering every hamlet was regaled with portrayals of Harrison's<br>
simple farm life at North Bend, where, a log cabin his dwelling, and<br>
hard cider--so one would have supposed--his sole beverage, he had been a<br>
genuine Cincinnatus. "Tippecanoe and Tyler" were therefore elected;<br>
their popular vote numbering 1,275,017, against 1,128,702 polled for Van<br>
Buren.<br>

<br>
<br>
However, this whig success, for a moment so imposing, proved superficial<br>
and brief. Harrison died at the end of his first month in office, and<br>
Tyler, coming in, showed that though training under the whig banner, he<br>
had not renounced a single one of his democratic principles. The Whigs<br>
scorned and soon officially repudiated him During the entire four years<br>
that he held office there was constant deadlock between him and the<br>
slight whig majority in Congress, which gave the Democrats main control<br>
in legislation. The panic of 1837 was forgotten, while the hold of the<br>
Democracy upon the country was so firm that its gains in Congress and<br>
its triumphs in the States once more went steadily on.<br>

CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
LIFE AND MANNERS IN THE FOURTH DECADE<br>
<br>
[1835]<br>
<br>
By the census of 1830 the United States had a population of 12,866,020,<br>
the increase having been for the preceding ten years about sufficient to<br>
double the inhabitants in thirty years. There were twenty-four States,<br>
Indiana having been taken into the Union in 1816, Mississippi in 1817,<br>
Illinois in 1818, Alabama in 1819, Maine in 1820, and Missouri, the<br>
last, in 1821. Florida, Michigan, and Arkansas were the Territories. The<br>
area, now that Florida had been annexed, was 725,406 square miles.<br>
<br>
Comparatively little of the soil of Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, and<br>
Wisconsin had as yet been occupied, though settlements were making on<br>
most of the larger streams. The southwest had at this time filled up<br>
more rapidly than the northwest. In 1830 the centre of population for<br>
the Union was farther south than it has ever been at any other time.<br>
Except in Louisiana and Missouri, not over thirty thousand inhabitants<br>
were to be found west of the Mississippi. The vast outer ranges of the<br>
Louisiana purchase remained a mysterious wilderness. Indianapolis in<br>
1827 contained twenty-five brick houses, sixty frame, and about eighty<br>
log houses; also a court-house, a jail, and three churches. Chicago was<br>
laid out in 1830. Thither in, 1834 went one mail per week, from Niles,<br>
Mich., on horseback. In 1833 it was incorporated as a town, having 175<br>
houses and 550 inhabitants. That year it began publishing a newspaper<br>
and organized two churches. In 1837 it was a city, with 4,170<br>
inhabitants. The Territory of Iowa had in 1836, 10,500 inhabitants; in<br>
1840, 43,000. At this time Wisconsin had 31,000. So early as 1835 Ohio<br>
had nearly or quite 1,000,000 inhabitants. Sixty-five of its towns had<br>
together 125 newspapers. Between 1830 and 1840 Ohio's population rose<br>
from 900,000 to 1,500,000; Michigan's, from 30,000 to 212,000; and the<br>
whole country's, from 13,000,000 to 17,000,000. Before 1840, eight<br>
steamers connected Chicago with Buffalo.<br>

<br>
By 1840 nearly all the land of the United States this side the<br>
Mississippi had been taken up by settlers. The last districts to be<br>
occupied were Northern Maine, the Adirondack region of New York, a strip<br>
in Western Virginia from the Potomac southward through Kentucky nearly<br>
to the Tennessee line, the Pine Barrens of Georgia, and the extremities<br>
of Michigan and Wisconsin. Beyond the Father of Waters his shores were<br>
mostly occupied, as well as those of his main tributaries, a good way<br>
from their mouths. The Missouri Valley had population as far as Kansas<br>
City. Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa Territory had many settlements at<br>
some distance from the streams. The aggregate population of the country<br>
was 17,069,453, the average density twenty-one and a tenth to the square<br>
mile. The mass of westward immigration was as yet native, since the<br>
great rush from Europe only began about 1847. This was fortunate, as<br>
fixing forever the American stamp upon the institutions of western<br>
States. To compensate each new commonwealth for the non-taxation of the<br>
United States land it contained, it received one township in each<br>
thirty-six as its own for educational purposes, a provision to which is<br>
due the magnificent school system of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa,<br>
Minnesota, and their younger sisters.<br>
<br>
Farther east, too, there had, of course, been growth, but it was slower.<br>
In 1827 Hartford had but 6,900 inhabitants; New Haven, 7,100; Newark, N.<br>
J., 6,500, and New Brunswick about the same. The State of New York paid<br>
out, between 1815 and 1825, nearly $90,000 for the destruction of<br>
wolves, showing that its rural population had attained little density.<br>
The entire country had vastly improved in all the elements of<br>
civilization. A national literature had sprung up, crowding out the<br>
reprints of foreign works which had previously ruled the market. Bryant,<br>
Cooper, Dana, Drake, Halleck, and Irving were now re-enforced by writers<br>
like Bancroft, Emerson, Hawthorne, Holmes, Longfellow, Poe, Prescott,<br>
and Whittier. Educational institutions were multiplied and their methods<br>
bettered, The number of newspapers had become enormous. Several<br>
religious journals were established previous to 1830, among them the New<br>
York Observer, which dates from 1820, and the Christian Register, from<br>
1821. Steam printing had been introduced in 1823. The year 1825 saw the<br>
first Sunday paper; it was the New York Sunday Courier. Greeley began<br>
his New York Tribune only in 1841.<br>
<br>
Fresh news had begun to be prized, as shown by the competition between<br>
the two great New York sheets, the Journal of Commerce and the Morning<br>
Enquirer, each of which, in 1827, established for this purpose swift<br>
schooner lines and pony expresses. The Journal of Commerce in 1833 put<br>
on a horse express between Philadelphia and New York, with relays of<br>
horses, enabling it to publish congressional news a day earlier than any<br>
of its New York contemporaries. Other papers soon imitated this example,<br>
whereupon the Journal extended its relays to Washington. Mails came to<br>
be more numerous and prompt. More letters were written, and, from 1839,<br>
letters were sent in envelopes. Postage-stamps were not used till 1847.<br>
Most of the principal cities in the country, including Rochester and<br>
Cincinnati, published dailies before 1830. Baltimore and Louisville had<br>
each a public school in 1829. This year witnessed in Boston the<br>
beginning work of the first blind asylum in the country. In Hartford<br>
instruction had already been given to the deaf and dumb since 1817.<br>
<br>

A Pony Express.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the fourth decade of the century the American character had assumed a<br>
good deal of definiteness and greatly interested foreign travellers.<br>
There was, by those who knew what foreign manners were, much foolish<br>
aping of the same. English visitors noted Brother Jonathan's drawl in<br>
talking, his phlegmatic temperament, keen eye, and blistering<br>
inquisitiveness. Jonathan was a rover and a trader, everywhere at home,<br>
everywhere bent upon the main chance. He ate too rapidly, chewed and<br>
smoked tobacco, and spat indecently. He drank too much. During the first<br>
quarter of the century nearly everyone used liquor, and drunkenness was<br>
shamefully common. Every public entertainment, even if religious, set<br>
out provision of free punch. At hotels, brandy was placed upon the<br>
table, free as water to all. The smaller sects often held preaching<br>
services in bar-rooms for lack of better accommodations. On such<br>
occasions the preacher was not infrequently observed, without affront to<br>
anyone, to refresh himself from behind the bar just before announcing<br>
his text.<br>
<br>
In 1824 commenced in Boston a temperance movement which accomplished in<br>
this matter the most happy reform. It swept New England, passing thence<br>
to all the other parts of the Union. By the end of 1829 over a thousand<br>
temperance societies were in existence. The distilling and importation<br>
of spirits fell off immensely. It became fashionable not to drink, and<br>
little by little drinking came to be stigmatized as immoral.<br>
<br>
By the time of which we now speak, the old habit of expressing<br>
solicitude for the fate of the Union had passed away. Whig like<br>
Democrat--so different from old Federalist-swore by "the people." Every<br>
American believed in America. Travelling abroad, the man from this<br>
country was wont to assume, and if opposed to contend, ill-manneredly<br>
sometimes, that its institutions were far the best in the world. No one<br>
wished a change. The unparalleled prosperity of all contributed to this<br>
satisfaction. Cities and towns came up in a day. Public improvements<br>
were to be seen making in every direction. There was no idle aristocracy<br>
on the one hand, no beggars on the other. Self-respect was universal.<br>
The people held the power. If men attained great wealth, as not a few<br>
did, they usually did not waste it but invested it. Business enterprise<br>
was intense and common. Character entered into credit as an element<br>
along with financial resources. People did not crowd into cities, but<br>
loved and built up the country rather. Laws and penalties were become<br>
more mild. In 1837 a man was flogged at the whipping-post in Providence,<br>
R. I., for horse-stealing, perhaps the last case of the kind in the<br>
country. Prisons were now made clean and healthy, and the idea of<br>
reforming the criminal instead of taking vengeance upon him was<br>
spreading. Reformatories for children had been opened in New York,<br>
Boston, and Philadelphia. There were institutions for homeless children,<br>
for the sick poor, for the insane, and for other unfortunate classes.<br>
<br>
By this time the Methodists and Baptists had become extremely strong in<br>
numbers. In 1833 the Massachusetts constitution was altered, abolishing<br>
obligatory contributions for the support of the ministry of the standing<br>
order. Connecticut had made the same change fifteen years before, in its<br>
constitution of 1818. In many localities the newer denominations,<br>
hitherto sects, were more influential than the old one, and in this<br>
abolition of ecclesiastical taxes they had with them Jews, atheists,<br>
deists, agnostics, and heathen.<br>
<br>
About 1825 began a period of peculiar religious enthusiasm. Missions to<br>
the heathen were instituted. Revivals were numerous and often shook<br>
whole neighborhoods for weeks and months. About this date Millerism<br>
began to make converts. William Miller, from whom it took its name,<br>
preached far and wide that the world would be destroyed in 1843,<br>
securing multitudes of disciples, who clung to his general belief even<br>
after his prophecy as to the specific date for the final catastrophe was<br>
seen to have failed. Mormonism was also founded, in 1830, and the Book<br>
of Mormon published by Joseph Smith. A church of this order, organized<br>
this year at Manchester, N. Y., removed the next to Kirtland, O., and<br>
thence to Independence, Mo. Driven from here by mob violence, they built<br>
the town of Nauvoo, Ill. Meeting in this place too with what they<br>
regarded persecution, several of their members being prosecuted for<br>
polygamy, they were obliged to migrate to Salt Lake City, where,<br>
however, they were not fully settled until 1848.<br>
<br>
As part of the same general stir we may perhaps register the<br>
anti-masonic movement. One William Morgan, a Mason residing in Western<br>
New York, was reported about to expose in a publication the secrets of<br>
that order. The Masons were desirous of preventing this and made several<br>
forcible efforts to that end. Morgan was soon missing, and the exciting<br>
assumption was almost universally made that the Masons had taken him<br>
off. There was much evidence of this; but conviction was found<br>
impossible because, as was alleged, judges, juries, and witnesses were<br>
nearly all Masons. An intense and widespread feeling was developed that<br>
Masonry held itself superior to the laws, was therefore a foe to the<br>
Government and must be destroyed. The Anti-Masons became a mighty<br>
political party. Masons were driven from office. In 1832 anti-masonic<br>
nominations were made for President and Vice-President, which had much<br>
to do with the small vote of Clay in that year. It was this party that<br>
brought to the front politically William H. Seward, Millard Fillmore,<br>
and Thurlow Weed.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
In 1833 Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania passed laws<br>
suppressing lotteries, but the gambling mania seemed to transform itself<br>
into a craze for banks. In many parts this was such that actual riots<br>
took place when subscriptions to the stock of banks were opened, the<br>
earliest comers subscribing the whole with the purpose of selling to<br>
others at an advance. To make a bank was thought the great panacea for<br>
every ill that could befall. In this we see that the American people,<br>
bright as they were, could be duped.<br>
<br>
Less wonder, then, at the success of the Moon Hoax, perpetrated in 1835.<br>
It was generally known that Sir John Herschel had gone to the Cape of<br>
Good Hope to erect an observatory. One day the New York Sun came out<br>
with what purported to be part of a supplement to the Edinburgh Journal<br>
of Science, giving an account of Herschel's remarkable discoveries. The<br>
moon, so the bogus relation ran, had been found to be inhabited by human<br>
beings with wings. Herschel had seen flocks of them flying about. Their<br>
houses were triangular in form. The telescope had also revealed beavers<br>
in the moon, exhibiting most remarkable intelligence. Pictures of some<br>
of these and of moon scenery accompanied the article. The fraud was so<br>
clever as to deceive learned and unlearned alike. The sham story was<br>
continued through several issues of the Sun, and gave the paper an<br>
enormous sale. As it arrived in the different places, crowds scrambled<br>
for it, nor would those who failed to secure copies disperse until some<br>
one more fortunate had read to them all that the paper said upon the<br>
subject. Several colleges sent professorial deputations to the Sun<br>
office to see the article, and particularly the appendices, which, it<br>
was alleged, had been kept back. Richard Adams Locke was the author of<br>
this ingenious deception, which was not exploded until the arrival of<br>
authentic intelligence from Edinburgh.<br>
<br>
Party spirit sometimes ran terribly high. A New York City election in<br>
1834 was the occasion of a riot between men of the&nbsp; two parties,<br>
disturbances continuing several days. Political meetings were broken up,<br>
and the militia had to be called out to enforce order. Citizens armed<br>
themselves, fearing attacks upon banks and business houses. When it was<br>
found that the Whigs were triumphant in the city, deafening salutes were<br>
fired. Philadelphia Whigs celebrated this victory with a grand barbecue,<br>
attended, it was estimated, by fifty thousand people. The death of<br>
Harrison was malignantly ascribed to overeating in Washington, after his<br>
long experience with insufficient diet in the West. Whigs exulted over<br>
Jackson's cabinet difficulties. Jackson's "Kitchen Cabinet," the power<br>
behind the throne, gave umbrage to his official advisers. Duff Green,<br>
editor of the United States Telegraph, the President's "organ," was one<br>
member; Isaac Hill, of New Hampshire, and Amos Kendall, first of<br>
Massachusetts, then of Kentucky, were others, these three the most<br>
influential. All had long worked, written, and cheered for Old Hickory.<br>
In return he gave them good places at Washington, and now they enjoyed<br>
dropping in at the White House to take a smoke with the grizzly hero and<br>
help him curse the opposition as foes of "the people."<br>
<br>
Major Eaton, Old Hickory's first Secretary of War, had married a<br>
beautiful widow, maiden name Peggy O'Neil, of common birth, and much<br>
gossipped about. The female members of other cabinet families refused to<br>
associate with her, the Vice-President's wife leading. Jackson took up<br>
Mrs. Eaton's cause with all knightly zeal. He berated her traducers and<br>
persecutors in long and fierce personal letters. His niece and<br>
housekeeper, Mrs. Donelson, one of the anti-Eatonites, he turned out of<br>
the White House, with her husband, his private secretary. The breach was<br>
serious anyway, and might have been far more so but for the healing<br>
offices of Van Buren, who used all his courtliness and power of place to<br>
help the President bring about the social recognition of Mrs. Eaton. He<br>
called upon her, made parties in her honor, and secured her entree to<br>
the families of the greatest foreign ministers. Mrs. Eaton triumphed,<br>
but the scandal would not down.<br>
<br>
When Jackson wrote his foreign message upon the French spoliation<br>
claims, his cabinet were aghast and begged him to soften its tone. Upon<br>
his refusal, it is said, they stole to the printing-office and did it<br>
themselves. But the proofs came back for Jackson's perusal. The lad who<br>
brought them was the late Mr. J. S. Ham, of Providence, R. I. He used to<br>
say that he had never known what profane swearing was till he listened<br>
to General Jackson's comments as those proofs were read.<br>
<br>
Jackson and Quincy Adams were personal as well as political foes. When<br>
the President visited Boston, Harvard College bestowed on him the degree<br>
of Doctor of Laws. Adams, one of the overseers, opposed this with all<br>
his might. As "an affectionate child of our Alma Mater, he would not be<br>
present to witness her disgrace in conferring her highest literary<br>
honors upon a barbarian." Subsequently he would refer, with a sneer, to<br>
"Dr. Andrew Jackson." The President's illness at Boston Adams declared<br>
"four-fifths trickery" and the rest mere fatigue. He was like John<br>
Randolph, said Adams, who for forty years was always dying. "He is now<br>

for a pleurisy, and posting to Cambridge for a doctorate of laws,<br>

<br>
To be sure, manifestations of a contrary spirit between the political<br>
parties were not wanting. The entire nation mourned for Madison after<br>
his death in 1836, as it had on the decease of Jefferson and John Adams<br>
both on the same day, July 4, 1826.<br>
<br>
A note or two upon costume may not uninterestingly close this chapter.<br>
<br>
Enormous bonnets were fashionable about 1830. Ladies also wore Leghorn<br>
hats, with very broad brims rolled up behind, tricked out profusely with<br>
ribbons and artificial flowers. Dress-waists were short and high. Skirts<br>
were short, too, hardly reaching the ankles. Sleeves were of the<br>
leg-of-mutton fashion, very full above the elbows but tightening toward<br>
the wrist. Gentlemen still dressed for the street not so differently<br>
from the revolutionary style. Walking-coats were of broadcloth, blue,<br>
brown, or green, to suit the taste, with gilt buttons. Bottle-green was<br>
a very stylish color for evening coats. Blue and the gilt buttons for<br>
street wear were, however, beginning to be discarded, Daniel Webster<br>
being one of the last to walk abroad in them. The buff waistcoat, white<br>
cambric cravat, and ruffled shirt still held their own. Collars for full<br>
dress were worn high, covering half the cheek, a fashion which persisted<br>
in parts of the country till 1850 or later.<br>

CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
INDUSTRIAL ADVANCE BY 1840<br>
<br>
[1840]<br>
<br>
During the War of 1812 we had in England an industrial spy, whose<br>
campaign there has perhaps accomplished more for the country than all<br>
our armies did. It was Francis C. Lowell, of Boston. Great Britain was<br>
just introducing the power loom. The secret of structure was guarded<br>
with all vigilance, yet Lowell, passing from cotton factory to cotton<br>
factory with Yankee eyes, ears, and wit, came home in 1814, believing,<br>
with good reason, as it proved, that he could set up one of the machines<br>
on American soil. Broad Street in Boston was the scene of his initial<br>
experiments, but the factory to the building of which they led was at<br>
Waltham. It was owned by a company, one of whose members was Nathan<br>
Appleton. Water furnished the motive power. By the autumn of 1814 Lowell<br>
had perfected his looms and placed them in the factory. Spinning<br>
machinery was also built, mounting seventeen hundred spindles. English<br>
cotton-workers did not as yet spin and weave under the same roof, so<br>
that the Lowell Mill at Waltham may, with great probability, be<br>
pronounced the first in the world to carry cloth manufacture<br>
harmoniously through all its several successive steps from the raw stuff<br>
to the finished ware.<br>
<br>
From this earliest establishment of the power-loom here, the<br>
cotton-cloth business strode rapidly forward. Fall River, Holyoke,<br>
Lawrence, Lowell, and scores of other thriving towns sprung into being.<br>
Every year new mills were built. In 1831 there were 801; in 1840, 1,240;<br>
in 1850, 1,074. Henceforth, through consolidation, the number of<br>
factories decreased, but the number of spindles grew steadily larger.<br>
This rise of great manufacturing concerns was facilitated by a new order<br>
of corporation laws. There had been corporations in the country before<br>
1830, as the Waltham case shows; but the system had had little<br>
evolution, as incorporation had in each case to proceed from a special<br>
legislative act. In 1837 Connecticut passed a statute making this<br>
unnecessary and enabling a group of persons to become a corporation on<br>
complying with certain simple requirements. New York placed a similar<br>
provision in its constitution of 1846. The Dartmouth College decision of<br>
the United States Supreme Court in 1819, interpreting an act of<br>
incorporation as a contract, which, by the Constitution, no State can<br>
violate, still further humored and aided the corporation system.<br>

<br>
In 1816 the streets of Baltimore were lighted with gas. A gas-light<br>
company was incorporated in New York in 1823. Not till 1836, however,<br>
did the Philadelphia streets have gas lights. The first savings-banks<br>
were established in Philadelphia and Boston in 1816. Baltimore had one<br>
two years later. Portable fire-proof safes were used in 1820. The Lehigh<br>
coal trade flourished this year, and also the manufacture of iron with<br>
coal. The whale fishery, too, was now beginning. The first factory in<br>
Lowell started in 1821. In 1822 there was a copper rolling mill in<br>
Baltimore, the only one then in America, and Paterson, N. J., began the<br>
manufacture of cotton duck. Patent leather was made in the United States<br>
by 1819. In 1824 Amesbury, Mass., had a water-power manufactory of<br>
flannel. The next year the practice of homoeopathy began in America, and<br>
matches of a rude sort were displacing the old tinder-box. The next<br>
year after this Hartford produced axes and other edged tools.<br>
Lithography, of which there had been specimens so early as 1818, was a<br>
Boston business in 1827. Pittsburgh manufactured damask table linen in<br>
1828. The same year saw paper made from straw, and planing machinery in<br>
operation. The insuring of lives began in this country in 1812.<br>

The first figured muslin woven by the power-loom in America, and perhaps<br>
in the world, was produced at Central Falls, R. I., in 1829. Calico<br>
printing began at Lowell the same year, also the manufacture of cutlery<br>
at Worcester, of sewing-silk at Mansfield, Conn., of galvanized iron in<br>
New York City. With the new decade chloroform was invented, in 1831,<br>
being first used as a medicine, not as an anaesthetic. Reaping machines<br>
were on trial the same year, and three years later machine-made wood<br>
screws were turned out at Providence. About the same time, 1832, pins<br>
were made by machinery, hosiery was woven by a power-loom process, and<br>
Colt perfected his revolver. In 1837 brass clocks were put upon the<br>
American market, and by 1840 extensively exported. Also in 1837 Nashua<br>
was making machinists' tools. By 1839 the manufacture of iron with hard<br>
coal was a pronounced success. In 1840 daguerreotypes began to appear.<br>
Steam fire-engines were seen the next year.<br>

<br>
<br>
So early as 1816 the New York and Philadelphia stages made the distance<br>
from city to city between sun and sun. The National Road from Cumberland<br>
was finished to Wheeling in 1820, having been fourteen years in<br>
construction and costing $17,000,000. It was subsequently extended<br>
westward across Ohio and Indiana. It was thirty-five feet wide,<br>
thoroughly macadamized, and had no grade of above five degrees. Over<br>
parts of this road no less than 150 six-horse teams passed daily,<br>
besides four or five four-horse mail and passenger coaches. In Jackson's<br>
time, when for some months there was talk of war with France and extra<br>
measures were thought proper for assuring the loyalty of Louisiana,<br>
swift mail connections were made with the Mississippi by the National<br>
Road. Its entire length was laid out into sections of sixty-three miles<br>
apiece, each with three boys and nine horses, only six hours and<br>
eighteen minutes being allowed for traversing a section, viz., a rate of<br>
about ten miles an hour. Great men and even presidents travelled by the<br>
public coaches of this road, though many of them used their own<br>
carriages. James K. Polk often made the journey from Nashville to<br>
Washington in his private carriage. Keeping down the Cumberland River to<br>
the Ohio, and up this to Wheeling, he would strike into the National<br>
Road eastward to Cumberland, Md. He came thus so late as 1845, to be<br>
inaugurated as President; only at this time he used the new railway from<br>
Cumberland to the Relay House, where he changed to the other new railway<br>
which had already joined Baltimore with Washington.<br>

Obverse and Reverse of a Ticket used in 1838 on the New York &amp;
Harlem<br>
Railroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
The first omnibus made its appearance in New York in 1830, the name<br>
itself originating from the word painted upon this vehicle. The first<br>
street railway was laid two years later. The era of the stage coach was<br>
at this time beginning to end, that of canals and railroads opening. Yet<br>
in the remoter sections of the country the old coach was destined to<br>
hold its place for decades still. Where roads were fair it would not<br>
uncommonly make one hundred miles between early morning and late<br>
evening, as between Boston and Springfield, Springfield and Albany. So<br>
soon as available the canal packet was a much more easy and elegant<br>
means of travel. The Erie Canal was begun in 1817, finished to Rochester<br>
in 1823, the first boat arriving October 8th. The year 1825 carried it<br>
to Buffalo. The Blackstone Canal, between Worcester and Providence, was<br>
opened its whole length in 1828; the next year many others, as the<br>
Chesapeake and Delaware, the Cumberland and Oxford in Maine, the<br>
Farmington in Connecticut, the Oswego, connecting the Erie Canal with<br>
Lake Ontario, also the Delaware and Hudson, one hundred and eight miles<br>
long, from Honesdale, Pa., to Hudson River. The Welland Canal was<br>
completed in 1830.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Salt-water transportation had meantime been much facilitated by the use<br>
of steam. It had been thought a great achievement when, in 1817, the<br>
Black Ball line of packet ships between New York and Liverpool was<br>
regularly established, consisting of four vessels of from four hundred<br>
to five hundred tons apiece. But two years later a steamship crossed the<br>
Atlantic to Liverpool from Savannah. It took her twenty-five<br>
days--longer than the time in which the distance often used to be<br>
accomplished under sail. In 1822 there was a regular steamboat between<br>
Norfolk and New York, though no steamboat was owned in Boston till 1828.<br>
The Atlantic was first crossed exclusively by steam-power in 1838, and<br>
the first successful propeller used in 1839. The last-named year also<br>
witnessed the beginning of a permanent express line between Boston and<br>
New York, by the Stonington route. The next year, the Adams Express<br>
Company was founded, doing its first business between these two cities<br>
over the Springfield route, in competition with that by the Stonington.<br>

<br>
<br>
But all these improvements were soon to be overshadowed by the work of<br>
the railway and locomotive. The first road of rails in America was in<br>
the Lehigh coal district of Pennsylvania. Its date is uncertain, but not<br>
later than 1825. In 1826, October 7th, the second began operation, at<br>
Quincy, Mass., transporting granite from the quarries to tide-water,<br>
about three miles. This experiment attracted great attention, showing<br>
how much heavier loads could be transported over rails than upon common<br>
roads, and with how much greater ease and less expense ordinary weights<br>
could be carried. The same had been demonstrated in England before.<br>
Locomotives were not yet used in either country, but only horse-power.<br>
The conviction spread rapidly that not only highway transportation but<br>
even that by canals would soon be, for all large burdens, either quite<br>
superseded or of secondary importance. In 1827 the Maryland Legislature<br>
chartered a railroad from Baltimore to Wheeling. The projectors, though<br>
regarding it a bold act, promised an average rate between the two cities<br>
of at least four miles per hour. Subscriptions were offered for more<br>
than twice the amount of the stock. The Massachusetts Legislature the<br>
same year appointed commissioners to look out a railway route between<br>
Boston and Hudson River. Also in this year a railway was completed at<br>
Mauch Chunk, Pa., for transporting coal to the landing on the Lehigh.<br>
The descent was by gravity, mules being used to haul back the cars.<br>
<br>
In most country parts, the new railway projects encountered great<br>
hostility. Engineers were not infrequently clubbed from the fields as<br>
they sought to survey. Learned articles appeared in the papers arguing<br>
against the need of railways and exhibiting the perils attending them.<br>
When steam came to be used, these scruples were re-enforced by the<br>
alleged danger that the new system of travel would do away with the<br>
market for oats and for horses, and that stage-drivers would seek wages<br>
in vain.<br>
<br>
The first trip by a locomotive was in 1828, over the Carbondale and<br>
Honesdale route in Pennsylvania. The engine was of English make, and run<br>
by Mr. Horatio Allen, who had had it built. This was a year before the<br>
first steam railroad was opened in England. July 4, 1828, construction<br>
upon the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad was begun. It, like the other
early<br>
roads, was built of stone cross-ties, with wooden rails topped with<br>
heavy straps of iron. Such ties were soon replaced by wooden ones, as<br>
less likely to be split by frost, but the wooden rail with its iron<br>
strap might be seen on branch lines, for instance, between Monocacy<br>
Bridge and Frederick City, Md., so late as the Civil War.<br>

<br>
The first railroad for passengers in this country went into operation<br>
between Charleston and Hamburg, S. C., in 1830. The locomotive had been<br>
gotten up in New York, the first of American make. It had four wheels<br>
and an upright boiler. This year the railroad between Albany and<br>
Schenectady was begun, and fourteen miles of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
opened<br>
for use. In 1831 Philadelphia was joined to Pittsburgh by a line of<br>
communication consisting of a railway to Columbia, a canal thence to<br>
Hollidaysburg, another railway thence over the Alleghanies to Johnstown,<br>
and then on by canal. The railway over the mountains consisted of<br>
inclined planes mounted by the use of stationary engines. It is<br>
interesting to notice the view which universally prevailed at first,<br>
that the locomotive could not climb grades, and that where this was<br>
necessary stationary engines would have to be used. Not till 1836 was it<br>
demonstrated that locomotives could climb. Up to the same date, also,<br>
locomotives had burned wood, but this was now found inferior to coal,<br>
and began to be given up except where it was much the cheaper fuel.<br>

<br>
<br>
From 1832 the railway system grew marvellously. The year 1833 saw<br>
completed the South Carolina Railroad between Charleston and the<br>
Savannah River, one hundred and thirty-six miles. This was the first<br>
railway line in this country to carry the mails, and the longest<br>
continuous one then in the world. Two years later Boston was connected<br>
by railway with Providence, with Lowell, and with Worcester, Baltimore<br>
with Washington, and the New York &amp; Erie commenced. In 1839
Worcester<br>
was joined to Springfield in the same manner, and in 1841 a passenger<br>
could travel by rail from Boston to Rochester, changing cars, however,<br>
at least ten times.<br>

<br>
THE YEARS OF SLAVERY CONTROVERSY 1840-1860<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
SLAVERY AFTER THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE<br>
<br>
[1820]<br>
<br>
Slavery would most likely never have imperilled the life of this nation<br>
had it not been for the colossal industrial revolution sketched above.<br>
Cotton had been grown here since, 1621, and some exportation of it is<br>
said to have occurred in 1747. Till nearly 1800 very little had gone<br>
from the United States to England, for by the old process a slave could<br>
clean but five or six pounds a day. In 1784, an American ship which<br>
brought eight bags to Liverpool was seized, on the ground that so much<br>
could not have been the produce of the United States. Jay's treaty, as<br>
first drawn, consented that no cotton should be exported from America.<br>
It changed the very history of the country when, in 1793, Eli Whitney<br>
invented the saw-gin, by which a slave could clean 1,000 pounds of<br>
cotton per day. Slavery at once ceased to be a passive, innocuous<br>
institution, promising soon to die out, and became a means of gain, to<br>
be upheld and extended in all possible ways. The cotton export, but<br>
189,316 pounds in 1791, and a third less in 1792, rose to 487,600 pounds<br>
in 1793, to 1,610,760 pounds in 1794, to 6,276,300 pounds in 1795, and<br>
to 38,118,041 pounds in 1804. Within five years after Whitney's<br>
invention, cotton displaced indigo as the great southern staple, and the<br>
slave States had become the cotton-field of the world. In 1869 the<br>
export was nearly 1,400,000,000 pounds, worth about $161,500,000.<br>
[Footnote: Johnson, in Lalor's Cyclopaedia, Art. "Slavery."]<br>
<br>
So profitable was slavery to vast numbers of individuals because of this<br>
its new status, that men would not notice how, after all, it militated<br>
against the nation's supreme interests. It polluted social relations in<br>
obvious ways, setting at naught among slaves family ties and the behests<br>
of virtue, influences that reacted terribly upon the whites. The entire<br>
government of slaves had a brutalizing tendency, more pronounced as time<br>
passed. "Plantation manners" were cultivated, which, displaying<br>
themselves in Congress and elsewhere, in all discussions and measures<br>
relating to the execrable institution, made the North believe that the<br>
South was drifting toward barbarism. This was an exaggeration, yet<br>
everyone knew that schools in the South were rare and poor, and thought<br>
and speech little free as compared with the same in the North. Political<br>
power, like the slaves, was in the hands of a few great barons, totally<br>
merciless toward even southerners who differed from them. It is of
course<br>
not meant that virtue, kindliness, intelligence, and fair-mindedness<br>
were ever wanting in that section, but they flourished in spite of the<br>
slave-system.<br>
<br>
Economically slavery was an equal evil, taking as was the superficial<br>
evidence to the contrary. No cruelty could make the slave work like a<br>
free man, while his power to consume was enormous. Infants, aged, and<br>
weak had to be supported by the owner. Even the best slaves were<br>
improvident. Everywhere slave labor tended to banish free. Upon slave<br>
soil scarcely an immigrant could be led to set foot. Poor whites grew<br>
steadily poorer, their lot often more wretched than that of slaves.<br>
Invention, care, forethought were as good as unknown among them. Slave<br>
labor proved incompetent even for agriculture, impoverishing the richest<br>
soil in comparatively few years, whence the perpetual impulse of the<br>
slave-owners to acquire new territory. The dishonesty of blacks and the<br>
danger of slave insurrections made property insecure, at the same time<br>
that the system diminished in every community the number of its natural<br>
defenders. The result was that the South, the superior of the North in<br>
natural resources, was, by 1800, rapidly becoming the inferior in every<br>
single element of prosperity.<br>
<br>
[1831]<br>
<br>
One of these insurrections was the event of 1831 in Virginia,<br>
originating near the southern border. Four slaves in alliance with three<br>
whites commenced it by killing several families and pressing all the<br>
slaves they could find into their service, until the force was nearly<br>
two hundred. They spread desolation everywhere. Fifty-five white persons<br>
were murdered before the insurrection was in hand. Virginia and North<br>
Carolina called out troops, and at last all the insurgents were captured<br>
or killed. The leader was a black named Nat Turner, who believed himself<br>
called of God to give his people freedom. He had heard voices in the air<br>
and seen signs on the sky, which, with many other portents, he<br>
interpreted as proofs of his divine commission. When all was over Turner<br>
escaped to the woods, dug a hole under some fence-rails and lived there<br>
for six weeks, coming out only at midnight for food. Driven thence by<br>
discovery, he still managed to hide here and there about the plantations<br>
in spite of a whole country of armed men in search of him, until at last<br>
he was accidentally confronted in the bush by a white man with levelled<br>
rifle. He was hanged, November 11th, and sixteen others later. His wife<br>
was tortured for evidence, but in vain. Twelve negroes were transported.<br>
Very many were, without trial, punished in inhuman ways, the heads of<br>
some impaled along the highway as a warning. Partly in consequence of<br>
this horrible affair, originated a stout movement for the abolition of<br>
slavery in Virginia. This was favored by many of the ablest men in the<br>
Old Dominion, but they were overruled.<br>
<br>
<br>

The Discovery of Nat Turner.<br>
<br>
<br>
Danger from the blacks necessitated the most rigid laws concerning them.<br>
Time had been when it was thought not dangerous to teach slaves to read.<br>
In 1742 Commissary Garden, of the English Society for Propagating the<br>
Gospel, founded a negro school in Charleston, where slaves were taught<br>
by slave teachers, these last being the society's property. Honest Elias<br>
Neale, the society's catechist in New York, engaged in the same work<br>
there, and afterward catechists were so employed in Philadelphia. That<br>
organization did much to stir up the planters to teach their slaves the<br>
rudiments of Christianity. [Footnote: Eggleston in Century, May, 1888.]<br>
Now, all this was changed. The strictest laws were made to keep every<br>
slave in the most abject ignorance, to prevent their congregating, and<br>
to make it impossible for abolitionists or abolitionist literature or<br>
influence to get at them.<br>
<br>
[1816]<br>
<br>
Inconvenient and perilous as slavery was, southern devotion to it for<br>
many reasons strengthened rather than weakened. The masses did not<br>
perceive the ruin the system was working, which, moreover, consisted<br>
with great profits to vast numbers of influential men and to many<br>
localities. Border States little by little gave up the hope of becoming<br>
free, the old anti-slavery convictions of their best men faltering, and<br>
the practical problem of emancipation, really difficult, being too<br>
easily decided insoluble. More significant, owing to a variety of<br>
circumstances, the abolition spirit itself greatly subsided early in the<br>
present century. Completion of the emancipation process in the North was<br>
assured by the action of New York in 1817, proclaiming a total end to<br>
slavery there from July 4, 1827. The view that each State was absolute<br>
sovereign over slavery within its own borders, responsibility for it and<br>
its abuses there ending with the State's own citizens, was now<br>
universally accepted. Success in securing the act of 1807, making the<br>
slave trade illegal from January 1, 1808, and affixing to it heavy<br>
penalties, lulled multitudes to sleep. This act, however, had effect<br>
only gradually, and its beneficence was greatly lessened in that it left<br>
confiscated negroes to the operation of the local law.<br>
<br>
Such quietude was furthered through the formation of the American<br>
Colonization Society in 1816, by easy philanthropists and statesmen,<br>
North as well as South, who swore by the Constitution as admitting no<br>
fundamental amendment, admired its three great compromises, loved all<br>
brethren of the Union except agitators, and deprecated slavery and the<br>
black race about equally; its mission negro deportation, but its actual<br>
efforts confined to the dumping of free blacks, reprobates, and<br>
castaways in some remote corner of the universe, for the convenience of<br>
slave-holders themselves. [Footnote: 3 Schouler's United States, 198.]<br>
<br>
[1839]<br>
<br>
Meantime much was occurring to harden northern hostility to slavery into<br>
resolute hatred, a fire which might smoulder long but could not die out.<br>
The fugitive slave law for the rendition of runaways found in free<br>
States operated cruelly at best, and was continually abused to kidnap<br>
free blacks. The owner or his attorney or agent could seize a slave<br>
anywhere on the soil of freedom, bring him before the magistrate of the<br>
county, city, or town corporate in which the arrest was made, and prove<br>
his ownership by testimony or by affidavit; and the certificate of such<br>
magistrate that this had been done was a sufficient warrant for the<br>
return of the poor wretch into bondage. Obstruction, rescue, or aid<br>
toward escape was fined in the sum of five hundred dollars. This is the<br>
pith of the fugitive slave act of 1793. It might have been far more<br>
mischievous but for the interpretation put upon it in the celebrated<br>
case of Prigg versus Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
Mr. Prigg was the agent of a Maryland slave-owner. He had in 1839<br>
pursued a slave woman into Pennsylvania, and when refused her surrender<br>
by the local magistrate carried her away by force. He was indicted in<br>
Pennsylvania for kidnapping, an amicable lawsuit made up, and an appeal<br>
taken to the United States Supreme Court. Here, in an opinion prepared<br>
by Justice Story, the Pennsylvania statute under which the magistrate<br>
had acted, providing a mode for the return of fugitives by state<br>
authorities, was declared unconstitutional on the ground that only<br>
Congress could legislate on the subject; but it was added that while a<br>
free State had no right in any way to block the capture of a runaway, as<br>
for example by ordering a jury trial to determine whether a seized<br>
person had really been a slave, so as to protect free persons of dark<br>
complexion, yet States might forbid their officers to aid in the<br>
recovery of slaves. As the act of 1793 did not name any United States<br>
officials for this service it became nearly inoperative. Spite of this<br>
terrible construction of the Constitution, which Chief Justice Taney<br>
thought should have included an assertion of a State's duty by<br>
legislation to aid rendition, many northern States passed personal<br>
liberty laws, besetting the capture of slaves with all possible<br>
difficulties thought compatible with the Constitution. The South<br>
denounced all such laws whatever as unconstitutional, and perhaps some<br>
of them were.<br>
<br>
[1835]<br>
<br>
Constitutional or not, they were needed. There were regular expeditions<br>
to carry off free colored persons from the coasts of New York and New<br>
Jersey, many of them successful. The foreign slave-trade, with its<br>
ineffable atrocities, proved defiant of law and preternaturally<br>
tenacious of life. A lucrative but barbarous domestic trade had sprung<br>
up between the Atlantic States, Virginia and North Carolina especially,<br>
and those on the Gulf, for the supply of the southern market. Families<br>
were torn apart, gangs of the poor creatures driven thousands of miles<br>
in shackles or carried coastwise in the over-filled holds of vessels, to<br>
live or die--little matter which--under unknown skies and strange,<br>
heartless masters.<br>
<br>
The slave codes of the southern States grew severer every year, as did<br>
legislation against free colored people. Laws were passed rendering<br>
emancipation more difficult and less a blessing when obtained. The<br>
Mississippi and Alabama constitutions, 1817 and 1819 respectively, and<br>
all those in the South arising later, were shaped so as to place general<br>
emancipation beyond the power even of Legislatures. Congress was even<br>
thus early--so it seemed at the North--all too subservient to the<br>
slave-holders, partly through the operation of the three-fifths rule,<br>
partly from fear that opposition would bring disunion, partly in that<br>
ambitious legislators were eager for southern votes. As to the Senate,<br>
the South had taken care, Vermont, Kentucky and Tennessee having evened<br>
the score, all before 1800, to allow no new northern State to be<br>
admitted unless matched by a southern. In addition to all this, the<br>
North had a vast trade with the South, and northern capitalists held to<br>
an enormous amount mortgages on southern property of all sorts, so that<br>
large and influential classes North had a pecuniary interest in<br>
maintaining at the South both good nature and business prosperity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
"IMMEDIATE ABOLITION"<br>
<br>
[1832]<br>
<br>
While slavery was thus strengthening itself upon its own soil and in<br>
some respects also at the North, its champions ever more alert and<br>
forward, its old foes asleep, these very facts were provoking thought<br>
about the institution and hostility to it, destined in time to work its<br>
overthrow. Interested people saw that slavery, so aggressive and<br>
defiant, must be fought to be put down, and that if the Constitution was<br>
its bulwark, as all believed, provided a tithe of what the South as well<br>
as the North had said of its evils was true, the whole country, and not<br>
the South only, was guilty in tolerating the curse. In 1821 Lundy began<br>
publishing his Genius of Universal Emancipation, seconded, from 1829, by<br>
the more radical Garrison.&nbsp; In 1831 Garrison founded the Liberator,<br>
whose motto, "immediate and unconditional emancipation," was intended as<br>
a rebuke to the tame policy of the colonizationists. "I am in earnest,"<br>
said the plucky man, when his utterances threatened to cost him his<br>
life, "I am in earnest, I will not equivocate, I will not excuse, I will<br>
not retreat a single inch, and I will be heard." These were startling<br>
tones. Had God turned a new prophet loose in the earth?<br>
<br>
The abolition spirit was a part of the general moral and religious<br>
quickening we have mentioned as beginning about 1825, and revealing<br>
itself in revivals, missions, a religious press, and belief in the end<br>
of the world as approaching. The ethical teaching of the great German<br>
philosopher, Emanuel Kant, denouncing all use of man as an instrument,<br>
began to take effect in America through the writings of Coleridge.<br>
Hatred of slavery was gradually intensified and spread. In 1832 rose the<br>
New England Anti-Slavery Society. In 1833 the American Society was<br>
organized, with a platform declaring "slavery a crime."<br>
<br>
[1833]<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 330px; height: 452px;" alt="" src="images/165Pic.jpg"><br>
John G. Whittier in 1833.<br>
<br>
<br>
This declaration marked one of the most important turning-points in all<br>
the history of the United States. It drew the line. It brought to view<br>
the presence in our land of two sets of earnest thinkers, with<br>
diametrically opposite views touching slavery, who could not permanently<br>
live together under one constitution. May, Phillips, Weld, Whittier, the<br>
Tappans, and many other men of intellect, of oratorical power, and of<br>
wealth, drew to Garrison's side. State abolition societies were<br>
organized all over the North, the Underground Railroad was hard worked<br>
in helping fugitives to Canada, and fiery prophets harangued wherever<br>
they could get a hearing, demanding "immediate abolition" in the name of<br>
God.<br>
<br>
The Abolitionists proposed none but moral arms in fighting<br>
slavery--papers, pamphlets, public addresses, personal appeals. They<br>
deprecated rebellion by slaves, and urged congressional action against<br>
slavery only in the District of Columbia, in the territories, and at<br>
sea, where the absolute jurisdiction of the general Government was<br>
admitted by nearly all. Nevertheless, southern hostility to them was<br>
indescribably ferocious and uncompromising. They were charged with<br>
instigating all the slave insurrections and insubordination that<br>
occurred, and with having made necessary the new, more diabolical<br>
discipline over blacks, both bond and free. Southern papers and<br>
Legislatures incessantly commanded that Abolitionists be delivered up to<br>
southern justice, their societies and their publications suppressed by<br>
law, and abolitionist agitation made penal. There were northerners quite<br>
ready to grant these demands. Rage against abolitionism, much of it, if<br>
possible, even more unreasoning, prevailed at the North. Garrison says<br>
that he found here "contempt more bitter, detraction more relentless,<br>
prejudice more stubborn, and apathy more frozen than among slave-owners<br>
themselves." The Church, politics, business--all interests save<br>
righteousness--seemed to bow to the false god. Of all utterances against<br>
abolitionism, those of clergymen and religious journals were the<br>
bitterest. To call slavery sin was the unpardonable sin.<br>

<br>
<br>
[1834-1836]<br>
<br>
In 1834, on July 4th, a mob broke up a meeting of the American<br>
Anti-Slavery Society in New York. A few days after, Lewis Tappan's house<br>
was sacked in the same manner, as well as several churches,<br>
school-houses, and dwellings of colored families. At Newark, N. J., a<br>
colored man who had been introduced into a pulpit by the minister of the<br>
congregation, was forcibly wrenched therefrom and carried off to jail.<br>
The pulpit was then torn down and the church gutted. In Norwich, Conn.,<br>
the mob pulled an abolitionist lecturer from his platform and drummed<br>
him out of town to the Rogues' March. In 1836 occurred the murder of<br>
Rev. E. P. Lovejoy, at Alton, Ill. He was the publisher of The Observer,<br>
an abolitionist sheet, which had already been three times suspended by<br>
the destruction of his printing apparatus. It was at a meeting held in<br>
Faneuil Hall over this occurrence that Wendell Phillips first made his<br>
appearance as an anti-slavery orator. Also in 1836 the office at<br>
Cincinnati in which James G. Birney published The Philanthropist, was<br>
sacked, the types scattered, and the press broken and sunk in the river.<br>
Birney was a southerner by birth, and had been a slave-holder, but had<br>
freed his slaves. Between 1834 and 1840 there was hardly a place of any<br>
size in the North where an Abolitionist could speak with certain safety.<br>
<br>

<br>
The destruction of colored people's houses became for a time an<br>
every-day occurrence in many northern cities. For some years the<br>
condition of the free blacks and their friends was hardly better north<br>
than south. Schools for colored children were violently opposed even in<br>
New England. One kept by Miss Prudence Crandall, at Canterbury, Conn.,<br>
was, after its opponents had for months sought in every manner to close<br>
it, destroyed by fire. The lady herself was imprisoned, and such schools<br>
were by law forbidden in the State. A colored school at Canaan, N. H.,<br>
was voted a nuisance by a meeting of the town; the building was then<br>
dragged from its foundations and ruined. Many who aided in these deeds<br>
belonged to what were regarded the most respectable classes of society.<br>
<br>
[1839-1840]<br>
<br>
Owing to the vagaries and unpatriotism of the Garrisonians, there was<br>
from 1840 schism in the abolition ranks. Garrison and his closest<br>
sympathizers were very radical on other questions besides that<br>
concerning the sin of slavery. They declared the Constitution "a league<br>
with death and a covenant with hell" because it recognized slavery. They<br>
would neither vote nor hold office under it. They upbraided the churches<br>
as full of the devil's allies. They also advocated community of<br>
property, women's rights, and some of them free love. Others, as Birney,<br>
Whittier, and Gerrit Smith, refused to believe so ill of the<br>
Constitution or of the churches, and wished to rush the slavery question<br>
right into the political arena. The division, far from hindering,<br>
greatly set forward the abolitionist cause. Perhaps neither abolition<br>
society, as such, had, after the schism of 1840, quite the influence<br>
which the old exerted at first, but by this time a very general public<br>
opinion maintained anti-slavery propagandism, pushing it henceforth more<br>
powerfully than ever, as well as, through broader modes of utterance and<br>
action, more successfully. Whittier, Lowell, Longfellow, each enlisted<br>
his muse in the crusade. Wendell Phillips's tongue was a flaming sword.<br>
Clergymen, politicians, and other people entirely conservative in most<br>
things, felt free to join the new society of political Abolitionists.<br>
<br>
In 1839 the Governor of Virginia made a requisition on Governor Seward<br>
of New York, to send to Virginia three sailors charged with having aided<br>
a slave out of bondage. Seward declined, on the ground that by New York<br>
law the sailors were guilty of no crime, as that law knew nothing of<br>
property in man. He accompanied his refusal with a discussion of slavery<br>
and slave law quite in the abolitionist vein. To a like call from<br>
Georgia, Seward responded in the same way, and his example was followed<br>
by other northern governors. The Liberty Party took the field in 1840,<br>
Birney and Earle for candidates, who polled nearly 7,000 votes. Four<br>
years later Birney and Morris received 62,300.<br>
<br>
It would be a mistake, let us remember, to regard the anti-abolitionist<br>
temper at the North wholly as apathy, friendliness to slavery, or the<br>
result of truckling to the South. Besides sharing the general fanaticism<br>
which mixed itself with the movement, the Abolitionists ignored the<br>
South's dilemma--the ultras totally, the moderates too much. "What<br>
would you do, brethren, were you in our place?" asked Dr. Richard<br>
Fuller, of Baltimore, in a national religious meeting where slavery was<br>
under debate; "how would you go to work to realize your views?" Dr.<br>
Spencer H. Cone, of New York, roared in reply, "I would proclaim liberty<br>
throughout all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof." But the thing<br>
was far from being so simple as that. Denouncing the Constitution as<br>
Garrison did could not but affront patriotic hearts. It was impolitic,<br>
to say the least, to import English co-agitators, who could not<br>
understand the intricacies of the subject as presented here.<br>

<br>
<br>
The fact that, defying slave-masters and sycophants alike, the cause of<br>
abolition still went on conquering and to conquer, was due much less to<br>
the strength of its arguments and the energy of its agitation than to<br>
the South's wild outcry and preposterous effrontery of demand.<br>
Conservative northerners began to see that, bad as abolitionism might<br>
be, the means proposed for its suppression were worse still, being<br>
absolutely subversive of personal liberty, free speech, and a free<br>
press. More serious was the conviction, which the South's attitude<br>
nursed, that such mortal horror at Abolitionists and their propaganda<br>
could only be explained by some sort of a conviction on the part of the<br>
South itself that the Abolitionists were right, and that slavery was<br>
precisely the heinous and damnable evil they declared it to be. It was<br>
mostly in considering this aspect of the case that the Church and clergy<br>
more and more developed conscience and voice on freedom's side, as<br>
practical allies of abolitionism. In each great denomination the South<br>
had to break off from the North on account of the latter's love to the<br>
black as a human being. Men felt that an institution unable to stand<br>
discussion ought to fall. By 1850 there were few places at the North<br>
where an Abolitionist might not safely speak his mind.<br>
<br>
It were as unjust as it would be painful to view this long, courageous,<br>
desperate defence of slavery as the pure product of depravity. The South<br>
had a cause, in logic, law, and, to an extent, even in justice. Both<br>
sides could rightly appeal to the Constitution, the deep, irrepressible<br>
antagonism of freedom against bondage having there its seat. The very<br>
existence of the Constitution presupposed that each section should<br>
respect the institutions of the other. What right, then, had the North<br>
to allow publications confessedly intended to destroy a legal southern<br>
institution, deeply rooted and cherished? From a merely constitutional<br>
point of view this question was no less proper than the other: What<br>
right had the South, among much else, to enact laws putting in prison<br>
northern citizens of color absolutely without indictment, when, as<br>
sailors, they touched at southern ports, and keeping them there till<br>
their ships sailed?&nbsp;&nbsp; This outrage had occurred repeatedly.
What was<br>
worse, when Messrs. Hoar and Hubbard visited Charleston and New Orleans,<br>
respectively, to bring amicable suits that should go to the Supreme<br>
Court and there decide the legality of such detention, they were obliged<br>
to withdraw to escape personal violence.<br>
<br>
It was said that the North must bear these incidents of slavery, so<br>
obnoxious to it, in deference to our complex political system. Yes, but<br>
it was equally the South's duty to bear the, to it, obnoxious incidents<br>
of freedom. Southern men seem never to have thought of this. Doubtless,<br>
as emancipation in any style would have afflicted it, the South could<br>
not but account all incitements thereto as hardships; but the North must<br>
have suffered hardships, if less gross and tangible, yet more real and<br>
galling, had it acceded to southern wishes touching liberty of person,<br>
speech, and the press. That at the North which offended the South was of<br>
the very soul and essence of free government; that at the South which<br>
aggrieved the North was, however important, certainly somewhat less<br>
essential. Manifestly, considerations other than legal or constitutional<br>
needed to be invoked in order to a decision of the case upon its merits,<br>
and these, had they been judicially weighed, must, it would seem, all<br>
have told powerfully against slavery. Not to raise the question whether<br>
the black was a man, with the inalienable rights mentioned in the<br>
Declaration of Independence, the South's own economic and moral weal,<br>
and further--what one would suppose should alone have determined the<br>
question--its social peace and political stability loudly demanded<br>
every possible effort and device for the extirpation of slavery. That<br>
this would have been difficult all must admit; that it was intrinsically<br>
possible the examples of Cuba and Brazil since sufficiently prove.<br>

CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
THE MEXICAN WAR<br>
<br>
[1836]<br>
<br>
Attracted by fertility of soil and advantages for cattle-raising, large<br>
numbers of Americans had long been emigrating to Texas. By 1830 they<br>
probably comprised a majority of its inhabitants. March 2, 1836, Texas<br>
declared its independence of Mexico, and on April 10th of that year<br>
fought in defence of the same the decisive battle of San Jacinto. Here<br>
Houston gained a complete victory over Santa Anna, the Mexican<br>
President, captured him, and extorted his signature to a treaty<br>
acknowledging Texan independence. This, however, as having been forced,<br>
the Mexican Government would not ratify.<br>
<br>
[1845]<br>
<br>
Not only did the Texans almost to a man wish annexation to our Union,<br>
but, as we have seen, the dominant wing of the democratic party in the<br>
Union itself was bent upon the same, forcing a demand for this into<br>
their national platform in 1840. Van Buren did not favor it, which was<br>
the sole reason why he forfeited to Polk the democratic nomination in<br>
1844. Polk was elected by free-soil votes cast for Birney, which, had<br>
Clay received them, would have carried New York and Michigan for him and<br>
thus elected him; but the result was hailed as indorsing annexation.<br>
Calhoun, Tyler's Secretary of State, more influential than any other one<br>
man in bringing it about, therefore now advocated it more zealously than<br>
ever. Calhoun's purpose in this was to balance the immense growth of the<br>
North by adding to southern territory Texas, which would of course<br>
become a slave State, and perhaps in time make several States. As the<br>
war progressed he grew moderate, out of fear that the South's show of<br>
territorial greed would give the North just excuse for sectional<br>
measures.<br>
<br>

General Sam. Houston.<br>
<br>
<br>
Henry Clay, with nearly the entire Whig Party, from the first opposed<br>
the Tyler-Calhoun programme. Clay's own reason for this, as his<br>
memorable Lexington speech in 1847 disclosed, was that the United States<br>
would be looked upon "as actuated by a spirit of rapacity and an<br>
inordinate desire for territorial aggrandizement." His party as a whole<br>
dreaded more the increment which would come to the slave power. After<br>
much discussion in Congress, Texas was annexed to the Union on January<br>
25, 1845, just previous to Polk's accession. June 18th, the Texan<br>
Congress unanimously assented, its act being ratified July 4th by a<br>
popular convention. Thus were added to the United States 376,133 square<br>
miles of territory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 333px; height: 422px;" alt=""
 src="images/182Pic.jpg"><br>
General Santa Anna.<br>
<br>
<br>
The all-absorbing question now was where Texas ended: at the Nueces, as<br>
Mexico declared, or at the Rio Grande, as Texas itself had maintained,<br>
insisting upon that stream as of old the bourne between Spanish America<br>
and the French Louisiana. Mexico, proud, had recognized neither the<br>
independence of Texas nor its annexation by the United States, yet would<br>
probably have agreed to both as preferable to war, had the alternative<br>
been allowed. To be sure, she was dilatory in settling admitted claims<br>
for certain depredations upon our commerce, threatened to take the<br>
annexation as a casus belli, withdrew her envoy and declined to accept<br>
Slidell as ours, and precipitated the first actual bloodshed. Yet war<br>
might have been averted, and our Government, not Mexico's, was to blame<br>
for the contrary result. Slidell played the bully, the navy threatened<br>
the coast, our wholly deficient title, through Texas, to the<br>
Nueces-Rio-Grande tract was assumed without the slightest ado to be<br>
good, and when General Arista, having crossed the river in Taylor's<br>
vicinity, repelled the latter's attack upon him, the President, followed<br>
by Congress, falsely alleged war to exist "by act of the Republic of<br>
Mexico."<br>
<br>
[1846]<br>
<br>
During most of 1845, General Zachary Taylor was at Corpus Christi on the<br>
west bank of the Nueces, in command of 3,600 men. The first aggressive<br>
movement occurred in March of the following year, when Taylor, invading<br>
the disputed territory by command from Washington, advanced to the Rio<br>
Grande, opposite Matamoras. April 26th, a Mexican force crossed the<br>
river and captured a party of American dragoons which attacked them.<br>
Taylor drew back to establish communication with Point Isabel, and on<br>
advancing again toward the Rio Grande, May 8th, found before him a<br>
Mexican force of nearly twice his numbers, commanded by Arista. The<br>
battle of Palo Alto ensued, and next day that of Resaca de la Palma,<br>
Taylor completely victorious in both. May 13th, before knowledge of<br>
these actions had reached Washington, warranted merely by news of the<br>
cavalry skirmish on April 26th, Congress declared war, and the President<br>
immediately called for 50,000 volunteers. In July Taylor was re-enforced<br>
by Worth, and proceeded to organize a campaign against Monterey, a<br>
strongly fortified town some ninety miles toward the City of Mexico.<br>
This place was reached September 19th, and captured on the 22d, after<br>
hard fighting and severe losses on both sides. An armistice of eight<br>
weeks followed.<br>

PLAN OF THE BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA MORNING 23 OF FEB 1847.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1847]<br>
<br>
Meantime a revolution had occurred in Mexico. The banished Santa Anna<br>
was recalled, and as President of the Republic assumed command of the<br>
Mexican armies. On February 23, 1847, occurred one of the most<br>
sanguinary but brilliant battles of the war, that of Buena Vista.<br>
Taylor, learning that a Mexican force was advancing under Santa Anna, at<br>
least double the 5,200 left him after the requisition upon him which<br>
General Scott had just made, drew back to the strong position of Buena<br>
Vista, south of Saltillo. Here Santa Anna, having through an intercepted<br>
despatch learned of Taylor's weakness, ferociously fell upon him with a<br>
force 12,000 strong. On right and centre, by dint of good tactics and<br>
bull-dog fighting, Taylor held his own and more, but the foe succeeded<br>
at first in partly turning and pushing back his left. The Mexican<br>
commander bade Taylor surrender, but was refused, whence the saying that<br>
"Old Rough and Ready," as they called Taylor, "was whipped but didn't<br>
know it."<br>
<br>
To check the flanking movement he sent forward two regiments of<br>
infantry, well supported by dragoons and artillery, who charged the<br>
advancing mass, broke the Mexicans' column, and sent them fleeing in<br>
confusion. This saved the day. The American loss was 746, including<br>
several officers, among them Lieutenant-Colonel Clay, son of the<br>
Kentucky statesman. Colonel Jefferson Davis, one day to be President of<br>
the Southern Confederacy, caused during this conflict great havoc in the<br>
enemy's ranks with his Mississippi riflemen. Santa Anna's loss was<br>
2,000.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 342px; height: 432px;" alt=""
 src="images/189Pic.jpg"><br>
General Winfield Scott.<br>
<br>
<br>
General Winfield Scott had meantime been ordered to Mexico as chief in<br>
command. Taylor was a Whig, and the Whigs whispered that his martial<br>
deeds were making the democratic cabinet dread him as a presidential<br>
candidate. But Scott was a Whig, too, and if there was anything in the<br>
surmise, his victorious march must have given Polk's political household<br>
additional food for reflection. Scott's plan was to reduce Vera Cruz,<br>
and thence march to the Mexican capital, two hundred miles away, by the<br>
quickest route. Vera Cruz capitulated March 27, 1847.<br>
<br>
Scott straightway struck out for the interior. He was bloodily opposed<br>
at Cerro Gordo, April 18th, and at Jalapa, but he made quick work of the<br>
enemy at both these places. In the latter city, after his victory, he<br>
awaited promised re-enforcements. When the last of these had arrived,<br>
August 6th, under General Franklin Pierce, so that he could muster about<br>
14,000 men, he advanced again. August 10th the Americans were in sight<br>
of the City of Mexico. This was a natural stronghold, and art had added<br>
to its strength in every possible way. Except on the south and west it<br>
was nearly inaccessible if defended with any spirit. Scott of course<br>
directed his attack toward the west and south sides of the city. The<br>
first battle in the environs of the capital was fiercely fought near the<br>
village of Contreras, and proved an overwhelming defeat for the<br>
Mexicans. Two thousand were killed or wounded, while nearly 1,000,<br>
including four generals, were captured, together with a large quantity<br>
of stores and ammunition. The American loss was only 60 killed and<br>
wounded.<br>
<br>
The survivors fled to Churubusco, farther toward the city, where, with<br>
every advantage of position, Santa Anna had united his forces for a<br>
final stand. An old stone convent, which our artillery could not reach<br>
till late in the action, was utilized as a barricade, and from this the<br>
Mexicans poured a most deadly fire upon their assailants. The Americans<br>
were victorious, as usual, but their loss was fearful, 1,000 being<br>
killed or wounded, including 76 officers. A truce to last a fortnight<br>
was now agreed upon, but Scott, seeing that the Mexicans were taking<br>
advantage of it to strengthen their fortifications, did not wait so<br>
long. He now had about 8,500 men fit for duty, and sixty-eight guns.<br>
Hostilities were renewed September 7th, by the storm and capture,<br>
costing nearly 800 men, of Molino del Rey, or "King's Mill," a mile and<br>
a half from the city.<br>
<br>
Possession of the Molino opened the way to Chapultepec, the Gibraltar of<br>
Mexico, 1,100 yards nearer the goal. As it was built upon a rock 150<br>
feet high, impregnable on the north and well-nigh so on the eastern and<br>
most of the southern face, only the western and part of the southern<br>
sides could be scaled. But the stronghold was the key to the city, and<br>
after surveying the situation, a council of war decided that it must be<br>
taken. Two picked American detachments, one from the west, one from the<br>
south, pushed up the rugged steeps in face of a withering fire. The<br>
rock-walls to the base of the castle had to be mounted by ladders. This<br>
was successfully accomplished; the enemy were driven from the building<br>
back into the city, and the castle and grounds occupied by our troops. A<br>
large number of fugitives were cut off by a force sent around to the<br>
north.<br>

<br>
To pierce the city was even now by no means easy. The approach was by<br>
two roads, one entering the Belen gate, the other the San Cosme. General<br>
Quitman advanced toward the Belen, but at the entrance was stopped by a<br>
destructive cannonade from the citadel itself. Those fighting their way<br>
toward the San Cosme succeeded in entering the city, Lieutenant U. S.<br>
Grant making his mark in the gallant work of this day. The city was<br>
evacuated that night, and on the 15th of September, 1847, was fully in<br>
the hands of Scott.<br>
<br>
The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2, 1848. It<br>
established the Rio Grande as the boundary between the two countries,<br>
and New Mexico, of course including what is now Arizona and also<br>
California, was ceded to the United States for $15,000,000. The United<br>
States also assumed, to the sum of $3,250,000, the claims of American<br>
citizens upon Mexico. For Gadsden's Purchase, in 1853, between the Gila<br>
River and the Mexican State of Chihuahua, we paid $10,000,000 more. Our<br>
territory thus received in all, as a consequence of the Mexican War, an<br>
increment of 591,398 square miles.<br>
<br>
Inseparable from the politics of the Mexican War is the Oregon question,<br>
since Oregon's re-occupation and "fifty-four forty or fight" had been<br>
democratic cries for securing to Polk west-northern votes in 1844. We<br>
had, however, no valid claim so far north, except against Russia--by the<br>
treaty of 1824. The Louisiana purchase, indeed, had vested us with<br>
whatever--very dubious--rights France had upon the Pacific, and the<br>
Florida treaty of 1819 gave us the far better title of Spain to the<br>
coast north of 42 degrees. This treaty, with Gray's discovery of the<br>
Columbia in 1792, Lewis and Clarke's official explorations of the<br>
Columbia valley in 1804-05-06, England's retrocession, in 1818, of<br>
Astoria, captured during the War of 1812, and extensive actual<br>
settlements upon the river by American citizens from 1832 on, made our<br>
claim perfect up to 49 degrees at least. This parallel the convention<br>
with Great Britain in 1818 had already fixed as our northern line from<br>
the Lake of Woods to the Rocky Mountains. Between this and 54 degrees 40<br>
minutes, England's title, from exploration and settlement, was superior<br>
to ours, which was based upon alleged old Spanish discovery. The same<br>
convention of 1818, renewed in 1827, opened the Oregon country to<br>
occupation by settlers from both nations. Increase of immigration<br>
rendering a fixing of jurisdictions imperative, England pressed for the<br>
line of the Columbia below its intersection of the forty-ninth parallel.<br>
We had twice offered to settle upon 49 degrees, which limit the rapid<br>
growth of our population in the region induced England in 1836 to<br>
accept. Whether Polk's blustering demand for "all Oregon," which came<br>
near bringing on war with England, and his much condemned recession<br>
later, were mere opportunist acts, is still a question. Many consider<br>
them pieces of a deep-laid policy by Polk to tole Mexico to war in hope<br>
of England's aid, then, suddenly pacifying England, to devour Mexico at<br>
his leisure.<br>

CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
CALIFORNIA AND THE COMPROMISE OF 1850<br>
<br>
[1846]<br>
<br>
One of the campaigns at the beginning of the Mexican War was that of<br>
General Stephen W. Kearney, from Fort Leavenworth, against New Mexico.<br>
It was opened in May, 1846. He invaded the country without much<br>
opposition, arrived at Santa Fe August 18th, having marched 873 miles,<br>
declared the inhabitants free from all allegiance to Mexico, and formed<br>
a territorial government over them as United States subjects.<br>
<br>
Captain John C. Fremont had previously, but in the same year, 1846, been<br>
sent to California at the head of an exploring expedition, and in May he<br>
was notified to remain in the country in anticipation of hostilities. On<br>
June 15th he captured Samona. Meanwhile, Commodore Sloat was erecting<br>
our flag over the towns on the coast. In July Sloat was superseded by<br>
Commodore Stockton, who routed the Mexican commander, De Castro, at Los<br>
Angeles, joined Fremont, and on August 13th seized Monterey, the then<br>
capital. The two commanders now placed themselves at the head of a<br>
provisional government for California.<br>

<br>
<br>
[1848-1849]<br>
<br>
In 1848, on the same day and almost at the same hour when the peace of<br>
Guadalupe Hidalgo was concluded, gold was discovered in California. It<br>
was on the land of one Sutter, a Swiss settler in the Sacramento Valley,<br>
as some workmen were opening a flume for a mill. In three months over<br>
4,000 persons were there, digging for gold with great success. By July,<br>
1849, it is thought, 15,000 had arrived. Nearly all were forced to live<br>
in booths, tents, log huts, and under the open sky. The sparse<br>
population previously on the ground left off farming and grazing and<br>
opened mines. People became insane for gold. Immigrants soon came in<br>
immense hordes. In 1846, aside from roving Indians, California had<br>
numbered not much over 15,000 inhabitants. By 1850, it seems certain<br>
that the territory contained no fewer than 92,597. The new-comers were<br>
from almost every land and clime--Mexico, South America, the Sandwich<br>
Islands, China--though, of course, most were Americans. The bulk of<br>
these hailed from the Northwest and the Northeast. To this land of<br>
promise the sturdy pioneers from the Mississippi Valley found their way<br>
on foot, on horseback, or in wagons, over the Rocky Mountains and the<br>
Sierras, following trails previously untrodden by civilized man. Those<br>
from the East made long detours around Cape Horn or across the Isthmus<br>
of Panama.<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 477px; height: 434px;" alt=""
 src="images/202Pic.jpg"><br>
Sutter's Mill, California, where Gold was First Discovered.<br>
<br>
<br>
The yield of gold from the virgin placers was enormous, a laborer's<br>
average the first season being perhaps an ounce a day, though many made<br>
much more. During the first two years about $40,000,000 worth of gold<br>
was extracted. According to careful estimates the gold yield of the<br>
United States, mostly from California, which had been only $890,000 in<br>
1847, increased to $10,000,000 in 1848, to $40,000,000 in 1849, to<br>
$50,000,000 in 1850, to $55,000,000 in 1851, to $60,000,000 in 1852, and<br>
in 1853 to $65,000,000.<br>
<br>
Most interesting were the spontaneous governmental and legal<br>
institutions which arose in these motley communities, some of them<br>
finding their originals in the English mining districts, others in<br>
Mexico and Spain, and still others recalling the mining customs of<br>
medieval Germany. For a time many camps had each its independent<br>
government, disconnected from all human authority around or above. Some<br>
of these were modelled after the Mexican Alcaldeship, others after the<br>
New England town. Over those who rushed to the vicinity of Sutter's mill<br>
that gentleman became virtual Alcalde, though he was not recognized by<br>
all. The men first opening a placer would seek to pre-empt all the<br>
adjoining land, giving up only when others came in numbers too strong<br>
for them. Officers were elected and new customs sanctioned as they were<br>
needed. Partnerships were sacredly maintained, yet by no other law than<br>
that of the camp. Crimes against property and life seem to have been<br>
infrequent at first, but the unparalleled wealth toled in and developed<br>
a criminal class, which the rudimentary government could not control.<br>
San Francisco formed in 1851 a vigilance committee of citizens, by which<br>
crimes could be more summarily and surely punished. The pioneer banking<br>
house in California began business at San Francisco in January, 1849.<br>
The same month saw the first frame house on the Sacramento, near<br>
Sutter's Fort.<br>
<br>
The vast acquisition of territory by the Mexican War seemed destined to<br>
be a great victory for slavery, because nearly all of it lay south of 36<br>
degrees 30 minutes and hence by the Missouri Compromise could become<br>
slave soil. But there was the complication that under Mexico all this<br>
wide realm had been free. To exist there legally slavery must therefore<br>
be established by Congress, making the case very different from the<br>
cases of Louisiana, Florida, and Texas, which came under United States<br>
authority already burdened. This predisposed many who were not in<br>
general opposed to slavery, against extending the institution hither.<br>
Early in the war a bill had passed the House, failing almost by accident<br>
in the Senate, which contained the famous Wilmot Proviso, so named from<br>
its mover in the House, that, except for crime, neither slavery nor<br>
involuntary servitude should ever exist in any of the territories to be<br>
annexed. Wilmot was a Democrat, and at this time a decided majority of<br>
his party favored the proviso. But the pro-slavery wing rallied, while<br>
the Whigs, disbelieving in the war and in annexation both, offered the<br>
proviso Democrats no hearty aid. In consequence it was defeated both<br>
then and after the annexation.<br>
<br>
The election of 1848 went for the Whigs, and the next March 4th, General<br>
Taylor became President. Though a southerner and a slave-holder, he was<br>
moderate and a true patriot. So rapid had been the influx into<br>
California that the Territory needed a stable government. Accordingly,<br>
one of Taylor's first acts as President was to urge California to apply<br>
for admission to statehood. General Riley, military governor, at once<br>
called a convention, which, sitting from September 1st to October 13th,<br>
framed a constitution and made request that California be taken into the<br>
Union. This constitution prohibited slavery, and thus a new firebrand<br>
was tossed into the combustible material with which the political<br>
situation abounded. By this time nearly all the friends of freedom were<br>
for the proviso, but its enemies as well had greatly increased. The<br>
immense growth, actual and prospective, of northern population, greatly<br>
inspired one side and angered the other.<br>
<br>
[1850]<br>
<br>
Resort was now had again to the old, illusive device of compromise, Clay<br>
being the leader as usual. He brought forward his "Omnibus Bill," so<br>
called because it threw a sop to everybody. It failed to pass as a<br>
single measure, but was broken up and enacted piecemeal. Stubborn was<br>
the fight. Radicals of the one part would consent to nothing short of<br>
extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific; those of the<br>
other stood solidly for the unmodified proviso.<br>
<br>
In this crisis occurred President Taylor's death, July 9, 1850, which<br>
was most unfortunate. He was known not to favor the pro-slavery<br>
aggression which, in spite of Clay's personal leaning in the opposite<br>
direction, the omnibus bill embodied. Mr. Fillmore, as also Webster,<br>
whom he made his Secretary of State, nervous with fear of an<br>
anti-slavery reputation, went fully Clay's length. The debate on this<br>
compromise of 1850 was the occasion when Webster deserted the free-soil<br>
principles which were now dominant in New England. His celebrated speech<br>
of March. 7th marked the crisis of his life. He argued that the proviso<br>
was not needed to prevent slavery in the newly gotten district, while<br>
its passage would be a wanton provocation to the South From this moment<br>
Massachusetts dropped him. When she next elected a senator for a full<br>
term, it was Charles Sumner, candidate of the united Democrats and<br>
Free-soilers, who went to Congress pledged to fight slavery to the<br>
death.<br>
<br>
But the omnibus compromises were passed. California was, indeed,<br>
admitted free, September 9, 1850--the thirty-first State in order--and<br>
slave-trade in the District of Columbia slightly alleviated. On the<br>
other hand, Texas was stretched to include a huge piece of New Mexico<br>
that was free before, and paid $10,000,000 to relinquish further claims.<br>
This was virtually a bonus to holders of her scrip, which from seventeen<br>
cents the dollar instantly rose to par. New Mexico and Utah were to be<br>
organized as Territories without the proviso, and were made powerless to<br>
legislate on slavery till they should become States. Least sufferable, a<br>
fugitive slave law was passed, so Draconian that that of 1793, hitherto<br>
in force, was benign in comparison. It placed the entire power of the<br>
general Government at the slave-hunter's disposal, and ordered rendition<br>
without trial or grant of habeas corpus, on a certificate to be had by<br>
simple affidavit. Bystanders, if bidden, were obliged to help marshals,<br>
and tremendous penalties imposed for aid to fugitives.<br>
<br>
This act facilitated the recovery of fugitives at first, but not<br>
permanently. Many who had labored for its passage soon saw that it was a<br>
mistake. It powerfully fanned the abolition flame all over the North.<br>
New personal liberty laws were enacted. A daily increasing number<br>
adopted the view that the new act was unconstitutional, on the ground<br>
that the Constitution places the rendition of slaves as of criminals in<br>
the hands of States, and guarantees jury trial, even upon title to<br>
property, if over twenty dollars in value. After the act had been<br>
justified in the courts, multitudes of moderate northern men urged to a<br>
dangerous degree the doctrine of state rights in defence of the liberty<br>
laws. Others adopted the cry of the "higher law," and without joining<br>
Garrison in denouncing the Government, did not hesitate to oppose in<br>
every possible way the operation of this drastic legislation for<br>
slave-catching.<br>

The country's growth made escape from bondage continually easier and<br>
easier. Once across the border a runaway was sure to find many friends<br>
and few enemies. Openly, or, if this was required, by stealth, he was<br>
passed quickly along to the Canada line. Between 1830 and 1860 over<br>
30,000 slaves are estimated to have taken refuge in Canada. By 1850,<br>
probably no less than 20,000 had found homes in the free States. The new<br>
law moved many of these across into the British dominions. It was hence<br>
increasingly difficult for the slave-owner to recover stray property.<br>
All possible legal obstructions were placed in his way, and when these<br>
failed he was likely still to be opposed by a mob which might prove too<br>
powerful for the marshal and any posse which he could gather.<br>

The Rendition of Anthony Burns in Boston.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Boston, when a slave named Shadrach was arrested, his friends made a<br>
sudden dash, rescued him from the officers and freed him. With Simms the<br>
same was attempted, but in vain.&nbsp; The removal of Anthony Burns
from that<br>
city in 1855 was possible only by escorting him down State Street to the<br>
revenue cutter in waiting, inside a dense hollow square of United States<br>
artillerymen and marines, with the whole city's militia under arms and<br>
at hand. Business houses as well as residences were closed and draped in<br>
mourning. It was an indignity which Massachusetts never forgot. At<br>
Alton, Ill., slave-hunters seized a respectable colored woman, long<br>
resident there, who fully believed herself free. She was surrounded by<br>
an infuriated company of citizens, and would have been wrenched from her<br>
captors' clutch had not they, in their terror, offered to sell her back<br>
into freedom. The needed $1,200 was raised in a few minutes, and the<br>
agonized creature restored to her family. Judge Davis, whom the evidence<br>
had compelled to deliver the woman, on rendering the sentence resigned<br>
his commission, declaring: "The law gives you your victim. Thank it and<br>
not me, and may God have mercy on your sinful souls."<br>

<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
THE FIGHT FOR KANSAS<br>
<br>
[1850-1854]<br>
<br>
The measures of 1850 proved anything but the "finality" upon slavery<br>
discussion which both parties, the Whigs as loudly as the Democrats,<br>
promised and insisted that they should be. Elated by its victory in<br>
1850, and also by that of 1852, when the anti-slavery sentiment of<br>
northern Whigs drove so many of their old southern allies to vote for<br>
Pierce, giving him his triumphant election, the slavocracy in 1854<br>
proceeded in its work of suicide to undo the sacred Missouri Compromise<br>
of 1820. Douglas, the ablest northern Democrat, led in this, succeeding,<br>
as official pacificator between North and South, somewhat to the office<br>
of Clay, who had died June 29, 1852. The aim of most who were with him<br>
was to make Kansas-Nebraska slave soil, but we may believe that Douglas<br>
himself cherished the hope and conviction that freedom was its destiny.<br>
<br>
This rich country west and northwest of Missouri, consecrated to freedom<br>
by the Missouri Compromise, had been slowly filling with civilized men.<br>
It did not promise to be a profitable field for slavery, nor would<br>
economic considerations ever have originated a slavery question<br>
concerning it. But politically its character as slave or free was of the<br>
utmost consequence to the South, where the resolution gradually arose<br>
either to secure it for the peculiar institution or else prevent its<br>
organization even as a Territory. A motion for such organization had<br>
been unsuccessfully made about 1843, and it was repeated, equally<br>
without effect, each session for ten years. None of these motions had<br>
contained any hint that slavery could possibly find place in the<br>
proposed Territory. The bill of December 15, 1853, like its<br>
predecessors, had as first drawn no reference whatever to slavery, but<br>
when it returned from the committee on Territories, of which Douglas was<br>
chairman, the report, not explicitly, indeed, made the assumption,<br>
unheard of before, that Kansas-Nebraska stood in the same relation to<br>
slavery in which Utah and New Mexico had stood in 1850; and that the<br>
compromise of that year, in leaving the question of slavery to the<br>
States to be formed from these Territories, had already set aside the<br>
agreement of 1820. These assumptions were totally false. The act of 1850<br>
gave Utah and New Mexico no power as Territories over the debatable<br>
institution, and contained not the slightest suggestion of any rule in<br>
the matter for territories in general.<br>
<br>
But the hint was taken, and on January 16th notice given of intention to<br>
move an out-and-out abrogation of the Missouri Compromise. Such<br>
abrogation was at once incorporated in the Kansas-Nebraska bill reported<br>
by Douglas, January 23, 1854. This separated Kansas from Nebraska, and<br>
the subsequent struggle raged in reference to Kansas alone. The bill<br>
erroneously declared it established by the acts of 1850 that "all<br>
questions as to slavery in the Territories," no less than in the States<br>
which should grow out of them, were to be left to the residents, subject<br>
to appeal to the United States courts. It passed both houses by good<br>
majorities and was signed by President Pierce May 30th. Its animus<br>
appeared from the loss in the Senate of an amendment, moved by S. P.<br>
Chase, of Ohio, allowing the Territory to prohibit slavery.<br>
<br>

<br>
Thus was first voiced by a public authority Judge Douglas's new and<br>
taking heresy of "squatter sovereignty," that Congress, though<br>
possessing by Article IV., Section iii., Clause 2 of the Constitution,<br>
general authority over the Territories, is not permitted to touch<br>
slavery there, but must leave it for each territorial populace "to vote<br>
up or vote down." At the South this doctrine of Douglas's was dubbed<br>
"nonintervention," and its real aim to secure Kansas a pro-slavery<br>
character avowed. It was consequently popular there as useful toward the<br>
repeal, although repudiated the instant its working bade fair to render<br>
Kansas free.<br>
<br>

Stephen A. Douglas.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1855]<br>
<br>
This was soon the prospect. Organizations had been formed to aid<br>
anti-slavery emigrants from the northern States to Kansas. The first was<br>
the Kansas Aid Society, another a Massachusetts corporation entitled the<br>
New England Emigrant Aid Society. There were others still. Kansas began<br>
to fill up with settlers of strong northern sympathies. They were in<br>
real minority at the congressional election of November, 1854, and in<br>
apparent minority at the territorial election the next March. The vote<br>
against them on the last occasion, however, was largely deposited by<br>
Missourians who came across the border on election day, voted, and<br>
returned. This was demonstrated by the fact that there were but 2,905<br>
legal voters in the Territory at the time, while 5,427 votes were cast<br>
for the pro-slavery candidates alone. These early successes gave the<br>
pro-slavery party and government in Kansas great vantage in the<br>
subsequent congressional contest. The first Legislature convened at<br>
Pawnee, July 2, 1855, enacted the slave laws of Missouri, and ordered<br>
that for two years all state officers should be appointed by legislative<br>
authority, and no man vote in the Territory who would not swear to<br>
support the fugitive slave law.<br>
<br>
The free-state settlers, now a majority, ignored this Legislature and<br>
its acts, and at once set to work to secure Kansas admission to the<br>
Union as a State without slavery. The Topeka convention, October 23,<br>
1855, formed the Topeka constitution, which was adopted December 14th,<br>
only forty-six votes being polled against it. This showed that<br>
pro-slavery men abstained from voting. January 15, 1856, an election was<br>
held under this constitution for state officers, a state legislature,<br>
and a representative in Congress. The House agreed, July 3d, by one<br>
majority, to admit Kansas with the Topeka constitution, but the Senate<br>
refused. The Topeka Legislature assembled July 4th, but was dispersed by<br>
United States troops.<br>
<br>
[1856-1857]<br>
<br>
This was done under command from Washington. President Pierce, backed by<br>
the Senate with its steady pro-slavery majority, was resolved at all<br>
hazards to recognize the pro-slavery authorities of Kansas and no other,<br>
and, as it seemed, to force it to become a slave State; but fortunately<br>
the House had an anti-slavery majority which prevented this. The friends<br>
of freedom in Kansas had also on their side the history that was all<br>
this time making in Kansas itself. During the summer of 1856 that<br>
Territory was a theatre of constant war. Men were murdered, towns<br>
sacked. Both sides were guilty of violence, but the free-state party<br>
confessedly much the less so, having far the better cause. Nearly all<br>
admitted that this party was in the majority. Even the governors, all<br>
Democrats, appointed by Pierce, acknowledged this, some of them, to all<br>
appearance, being removed as a punishment for the admission. Governor<br>
Geary, in office from September, 1856, to March, 1857, and Governor<br>
Walker, in office from May, 1857, were just and able men, and their<br>
decisions, in most things favorable to the free-state cause, had much<br>
weight with the country.<br>
<br>
Walker's influence in the Territory led the free-state men to take part<br>
in the territorial election of October, 1857, where they were entirely<br>
triumphant. But the old, pro-slavery Legislature had called a<br>
constitutional convention, which met at Lecompton, September, 1857, and<br>
passed the Lecompton constitution. This constitution sanctioned slavery<br>
and provided against its own submission to popular vote. It ordained<br>
that only its provision in favor of slavery should be so submitted. This<br>
pro-slavery clause was adopted, but only because the free-state men<br>
would not vote. The Topeka Legislature submitted the whole constitution<br>
to popular vote, when it was overwhelmingly rejected. The President and<br>
Senate, however, urged statehood under the Lecompton constitution,<br>
although popular votes in Kansas twice more, April, 1858, and March,<br>
1859, had adopted constitutions prohibiting slavery, the latter being<br>
that of Wyandotte. But the House still stood firm. Kansas was not<br>
admitted to the Union till January 29, 1861, when her chief foes in the<br>
United States Senate had seceded from the Union. She came in with the<br>
Wyandotte constitution and hence as a free State.<br>
<br>
It was during the debate upon Kansas affairs in 1856 that Preston S.<br>
Brooks, a member of the House from South Carolina, made his cowardly<br>
attack upon Charles Sumner. Sumner had delivered a powerful speech upon<br>
the crime against Kansas, worded and delivered, naturally but<br>
unfortunately, with some asperity. In this speech he animadverted<br>
severely upon South Carolina and upon Senator Butler from that State.<br>
This gave offence to Brooks, a relative of Butler, and coming into the<br>
Senate Chamber while Sumner was busy writing at his desk, he fell upon<br>
him with a heavy cane, inflicting injuries from which Sumner never<br>
recovered, and which for four years unfitted him for his senatorial<br>
duties. Sumner's colleague, Henry Wilson, in an address to the Senate,<br>
characterized the assault as it deserved. He was challenged by Brooks,<br>
but refused to fight on the ground that duelling was part of the<br>
barbarism which Brooks had shown in caning Sumner. Anson Burlingame,<br>
representative from Massachusetts, who had publicly denounced the<br>
caning, was challenged by Brooks and accepted the challenge, but, as he<br>
named Canada for the place of meeting, Brooks declined to fight him for<br>
the ostensible reason that the state of feeling in the North would<br>
endanger his life upon the journey. A vote to expel Brooks had a<br>
majority in the House, though not the necessary two-thirds. He resigned,<br>
but was at once re-elected by his South Carolina constituency.<br>

While the fierce Kansas controversy had been raging, the South had grown<br>
cold toward the Douglas doctrine of popular sovereignty, and had<br>
gradually adopted another view based upon Calhoun's teachings. This was<br>
to the effect that Congress, not under Article IV., section iii., clause<br>
2, but merely as the agent of national sovereignty, rightfully<br>
legislates for the Territories in all things, yet, in order to carry out<br>
the constitutional equality of the States in the Territories, is obliged<br>
to treat slaves found there precisely like any other property. If one<br>
citizen wishes to hold slaves, all the rest opposing, the general<br>
Government must support him. It is obvious how antagonistic this thought<br>
was to that of Douglas, since, according to the latter, a majority of<br>
the inhabitants in a Territory could elect to exclude slavery as well as<br>
to establish it.<br>
<br>
The new southern or Calhoun theory assumed startling significance for<br>
the Nation when, in 1857, it was proclaimed in the Dred Scott decision<br>
of the United States Supreme Court as part of the innermost life of our<br>
Constitution. Dred Scott was a slave of an army officer, who had taken<br>
him from Missouri first into Illinois, a free State, then into<br>
Wisconsin, covered by the Missouri Compromise, then back into Missouri.<br>
Here the slave learned that by decisions of the Missouri courts his life<br>
outside of Missouri constituted him free, and in 1848, having been<br>
whipped by his master, he prosecuted him for assault. The decision was<br>
in his favor, but was reversed when appeal was taken to the Missouri<br>
Supreme Court. Dred Scott was now sold to one Sandford, of New York. Him<br>
also he prosecuted for assault, but as he and Sandford belonged to<br>
different States this suit went to the United States Circuit Court.<br>
Sandford pleaded that this lacked jurisdiction, as the plaintiff was not<br>
a citizen of Missouri but a slave.<br>
<br>
It was this last issue which made the case immortal. The Circuit Court<br>
having decided in the defendant's favor, the plaintiff took an appeal to<br>
the Supreme Court. Here the verdict was against the citizenship of the<br>
negro, and therefore against the jurisdiction of the court below. The<br>
upper court did not stop with this simple dictum, hard and dubious as it<br>
was, but proceeded to lay down as law an astounding course of<br>
pro-slavery reasoning. In this it confined the ordinance of 1787 to the<br>
old northwestern territory, declared the Missouri Compromise and all<br>
other legislation against slavery in Territories unconstitutional, and<br>
the slave character portable not only into all the Territories but into<br>
all the States as well, slavery having everywhere all presupposition in<br>
its favor and freedom being on the defensive. The denial of Scott's<br>
citizenship was based solely upon his African descent, the inevitable<br>
implication being that no man of African blood could be an American<br>
citizen.<br>
<br>
This decision rendered jubilant all friends of slavery, as also the<br>
ultra Abolitionists, but correspondingly disheartened the sober friends<br>
of human liberty. How, it was asked, is the cause of freedom to be<br>
advanced when the supreme law of the land, as interpreted by the highest<br>
tribunal existing for that purpose, virtually establishes slavery in New<br>
England itself, provided any slave-master wishes to come there with his<br>
troop? But anti-slavery men did not despair. Patriots had of course to<br>
obey the court till its opinion should be reversed, yet its opinion was<br>
at once repudiated as bad law. Men like Sumner, Wilson, Chase, Giddings,<br>
Seward, and Lincoln, appealing to both the history and the letter of the<br>
Constitution, and to the course of legislation and of judicial decisions<br>
on slavery even in the slave States, had been elaborating and<br>
demonstrating the counter theory, under which our fundamental law<br>
appeared as anything but a "covenant with hell."<br>
<br>
The pith of this counter theory was that slaves were property not by<br>
moral, natural, or common law, but only by state law, that hence<br>
freedom, not slavery, was the heart and universal presupposition of our<br>
government, and that slavery, not freedom, was bound to show reasons for<br>
its existence anywhere. This being so, while Calhoun and Taney were<br>
right as against Douglas in ascribing to Congress all power over the<br>
Territories, it was as impossible to find slaves in any United States<br>
Territory as to find a king there. Slaves taken into Territories<br>
therefore became free. Slaves taken into any free State became free.<br>
Slaves carried from a slave State on to the high seas became free. Even<br>
the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution must be applied in the way<br>
least favorable to slavery.<br>
<br>
On the other hand Douglas was right in his view that citizens and not<br>
States were the partners in the Territories. As to the assertion of<br>
incompatibility between citizenship and African blood, it would not<br>
stand historical examination a moment. If it was true that the framers<br>
of the Constitution did not consciously include colored persons in the<br>
"ourselves and our posterity" for whom they purposed the "Blessings of<br>
Liberty," neither did they consciously exclude, as is clear from the<br>
fact that nearly everyone of them expected blacks some time to be free.<br>
<br>
<br>

CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
SLAVERY AND THE OLD PARTIES<br>
<br>
[1841]<br>
<br>
The Democratic Party was predominantly southern, the Whig northern. Both<br>
sought to be of national breadth, but the democratic with much the<br>
better success. Democracy would not give up its northern vote nor the<br>
Whigs their southern; but a better party fealty, due to a longer and<br>
prouder party history, rendered the Democrats far the more independent<br>
and bold in the treatment of their out-lying wing. The consequence was<br>
that while its rank and file at the North never loved slavery, they<br>
tolerated it and became its apologists in a way to make the party as a<br>
whole not only in appearance but in effect the pliant organ of the<br>
slavocracy. This status became more pronounced with the progress of the<br>
controversy and of the South's self-assertion. It was real under<br>
Jackson, rigid under Van Buren, manifest and almost avowed under Polk,<br>
Pierce, and Buchanan.<br>
<br>
Whig temper toward slavery was throughout the North much better, but<br>
whig party action was little better. Fear of losing southern supporters<br>
permanently forbade all frank enlistment by the Whig Party for freedom.<br>
The mighty leaders, Adams, Webster, even Clay, were well inclined, and<br>
the party, as such, was at the South persistently accused of alliance<br>
with the Abolitionists. This was untrue. Abolitionists, Liberal Party<br>
men, and Free-soilers oftener voted with Democrats than with Whigs. Clay<br>
complained once that Abolitionists denounced him as a slave-holder,<br>
slave-holders as an Abolitionist, while both voted for Van Buren.<br>
Compromise was the bane of this party as of the other; and each of the<br>
resplendent chieftains named at one time or another seemed so reverent<br>
to Belial that the record is painful reading.<br>
<br>
When in 1841 the ship Creole sailed from Richmond with one hundred and<br>
thirty-five slaves on board bound for the southern market, and one<br>
Madison Washington, a recovered runaway on board, headed a dash upon<br>
captain and crew, got possession of the vessel and took her into New<br>
Providence, Clay was as loud as Calhoun or any southern senator in<br>
demanding of the English Government the return of these slaves to<br>
bondage or, at least, that of "the mutineers," as they were called.<br>
Webster, Secretary of State at the time, instructed Edward Everett, our<br>
English minister, to insist upon this, his arguments being sound and his<br>
tone emphatic enough to please Mr. Calhoun. This was the time when<br>
Giddings, of Ohio, brought into the House his resolutions to the effect<br>
that slavery was a state institution only, and that hence any slave<br>
carried on to the open ocean or to any other locality where only<br>
national law prevailed, was free. He was censured in the House by a<br>
large majority and resigned, but his Ohio constituency immediately<br>
re-elected him.<br>
<br>
[1836-1844]<br>
<br>
Up to this time Giddings and Adams were the only pronounced anti-slavery<br>
men in that body. Adams had acquiesced in the Missouri Compromise, but<br>
all his subsequent career, especially his course in the House of<br>
Representatives after 1830, is not only creditable to him so far as the<br>
slavery question is concerned, but registers him as one of the most<br>
influential opponents of slavery in our history. Refusing to be classed<br>
with the Abolitionists, he was, in effect, the most efficient<br>
Abolitionist of them all.<br>
<br>
Previous to 1835, though petitions against slavery reached Congress in<br>
great numbers and nettled many members, they had been received and<br>
referred in the usual manner. But in February, 1836, the House created a<br>
special committee to consider these petitions. It reported a resolution,<br>
which passed under the previous question, that thereafter all papers of<br>
the kind should be tabled without printing or reference. Adams declared<br>
to the House: "I hold the resolution to be a direct violation of the<br>
Constitution of the United States, the rules of this House, and the<br>
rights of my constituents." In this rencounter Adams advanced the view<br>
on which the Emancipation Proclamation by and by proceeded, that<br>
slavery, even in States, was not beyond reach of the national arm, but<br>
would be at the mercy of Congress the instant slave-masters should<br>
rebel. This, the first of the gag laws, was, however, enacted. The<br>
second, or Patton gag, was passed on December 21, 1837, and the third,<br>
or Atherton gag, a year later. The principle of these, practically<br>
cutting off all petitions to Congress respecting slavery, was taken up<br>
in the twenty-first rule of the House in 1840.<br>
<br>
Mr. Adams was from the first the resolute and uncompromising foe of the<br>
gag policy. Wagon-loads of petitions came to him to offer, among them<br>
one for his own expulsion from the House and one to dissolve the Union,<br>
and he presented all.<br>
<br>
February 6, 1837, he inquired of Mr. Speaker whether or not it would be<br>
appropriate to offer a petition in his hand from slaves, whereupon the<br>
pro-slavery members flew at him like vampires. After much uproar, in<br>
which Adams gave as good as was sent him, he sarcastically reminded his<br>
already infuriated assailants that the petition was in favor of slavery,<br>
not against, and that he had emphatically not offered it, but only made<br>
an innocent inquiry of the Speaker about doing so, the proper answer to<br>
which was so far from obvious that the Speaker himself had signified his<br>
intention to take the sense of the House upon it. Regularly, year after<br>
year, Adams moved the abolition of the gag rule, was beaten as<br>
regularly, long as a matter of course, sometimes after heated debate in<br>
which he was always victor. But little by little the majority vote<br>
against him lessened. In 1842 the gag passed by but four votes, in 1843<br>
it had a majority of three only, in 1844 his motion to strike it out was<br>
carried by a vote of one hundred and eight to eighty. Adams wrote that<br>
day in his diary: "Blessed, forever blessed be the name of God."<br>
<br>
[1850]<br>
<br>
But a plenitude of Whigs, not all southern, voted for each of these<br>
gags. The worst one of all was moved by a Whig. The XXVIIth Congress,<br>
strongly whig, voted to retain the gag, which it was left for the<br>
XXVIIIth, strongly democratic, finally to repeal. At the South, slavery<br>
more and more overbore party feeling. Said Dixon, a Kentucky Whig, in<br>
1854, "Upon the question of slavery I know no Whiggery, no Democracy--I<br>
am a pro-slavery man." It should be added, however, that as the<br>
conflict progressed, pro-slavery Whigs became few save in the South, and<br>
that these nearly all soon turned Democrats.<br>
<br>
Most humiliating was the vassalage to the slave power displayed by<br>
northern congressmen of both parties, though forming a majority in the<br>
House during all the great days of the slavery battle. The gag history<br>
is one example. Resolutions against unquestionably unconstitutional laws<br>
imprisoning northern seamen at southern ports simply because they were<br>
colored, were tabled in the House by a large majority. Slavery in the<br>
District of Columbia, where Congress had the right of "exclusive<br>
legislation in all cases whatsoever," so that the entire nation was<br>
responsible, defied every effort to abolish it till 1862, after the<br>
Civil War began. Nor was the trade there in aught alleviated till 1850,<br>
when some modification of it was possible as an element of the<br>
compromise described in the preceding chapter. An enlargement of<br>
Missouri, adding to the northwest corner of that State, as slave<br>
territory, a vast tract which the Missouri Compromise had forever<br>
devoted to freedom, being in truth a preliminary repeal of that pact,<br>
was carried without opposition.<br>
<br>
The brutal and murderous lawlessness practised against Abolitionists was<br>
praised by northern congressmen often as slavery came up in debate. Even<br>
Senator Silas Wright, of New York, subsequently famous as a foe of<br>
slavery, in remarks upon the reference of anti-slavery petitions,<br>
boasted of the atrocities at Utica in 1835 and of others similar, as<br>
proof that "resistance to these dangerous and wicked agitators in the<br>
North had reached a point beyond law and above law." A bill, in 1836,<br>
for closing the mails to abolitionist literature, another defiance of<br>
the Constitution, Amendment I., secured engrossment in the Senate by the<br>
casting vote of Vice-President Van Buren; Wright, Tallmadge, and<br>
Buchanan also favoring; but failed to pass, nineteen to twenty-five,<br>
because Benton, Clay, and Crittenden had the patriotism to vote nay.<br>
<br>
Discussion hereon laid bare the vital contradiction in our governmental<br>
system. Calhoun showed that the Constitution permits each State for<br>
itself to define, in order to inhibit, incendiary literature.<br>
Characteristically, he would have forced mail agents to obey state laws<br>
upon this matter. Yet for Congress to have so directed would plainly<br>
have been abridging freedom of the press.<br>
<br>
<br>

Thomas H. Benton.<br>
<br>
<br>
Had the Whig Party, while in power from 1849 to 1853, been brave enough<br>
boldly to assume a rational anti-slavery attitude, though it might have<br>
been defeated, as it was in 1852, it would have had a future. The chance<br>
passed unimproved. The temporizing attitude of the party's then leaders<br>
and the known pro-slavery feeling of most of its southern<br>
members--twelve Whigs voting in the House for the repeal of the Missouri<br>
Compromise--proved deadly to the organization, its faithful old<br>
battalions going over in the South to the Democrats, in the North to the<br>
Republicans.<br>
<br>
Many Whigs took the latter course by a circuitous route. Ever since the<br>
alien and sedition laws, cry had been raised at intervals against the<br>
too easy attainment of citizenship by the unnumbered immigrants<br>
thronging to our shores, and agitation raised, more or less successful,<br>
to thrust forward "Nativism" or Americanism, with opposition to the<br>
Roman Catholic Church, as an issue in our politics. To such movements<br>
Whigs, as legatees of Federalism, were always more friendly than<br>
Democrats, which was partly a cause and partly a consequence of the<br>
affinity that naturalized citizens all along showed for the Democratic<br>
Party.<br>
<br>
Americanism had its greatest run after 1850, when the Whigs saw their<br>
organization going to pieces, and, mistakenly in part, attributed<br>
democratic success to the immigrant vote. A secret fraternity arose,<br>
called the "Know-nothings," from "I don't know," the ever-repeated reply<br>
of its members to inquiry about its nature and doings. "America for<br>
Americans" was their cry, and they proposed to "put none but Americans<br>
on guard." At first pursuing their aims through silent manipulation of<br>
the old parties, by 1854 the Know-nothings swung out as a third party.<br>
From this date they lustily competed with the Republicans for the hosts<br>
of whig and democratic stragglers jostled from their old ranks by the<br>
omnibus bill legislation, the Kansas-Nebraska act, and the "Crime<br>
against Kansas" committed by Pierce and his slavocratic Senate. In 1855<br>
this party assumed national proportions, and worried seasoned<br>
politicians not a little; but having crystallized around no living<br>
issue, like that which nerved Republicanism, it fell like a<br>
rocket-stick, its sparks going over to make redder still republican<br>
fires. Henry Wilson became a Republican from the status of a<br>
Know-nothing; so did Banks, Colfax, and a score of others subsequently<br>
eminent among their new associates. Some had of old been Democrats,<br>
though most had been Whigs.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding many appearances to the contrary, the Democracy had<br>
begun to lose its hold upon the North from the moment of Polk's<br>
nomination in 1844. In that act it showed preference, on the score of<br>
availability, for a small man as presidential candidate. Harrison's<br>
election and Van Buren's defeat in 1840 doubtless had something to do<br>
with this. The same disposition was revealed in 1852, when Pierce was<br>
made candidate. What harmed the party still more was swerving from<br>
strict construction in declaring for the annexation of Texas, which in<br>
this case did not imply enlargement of view in reading the Constitution,<br>
but simply subserviency to the slave power. In this way Van Buren was<br>
alienated and the vote of New York lost in 1848, insuring defeat that<br>
year.<br>
<br>
[1856-1860]<br>
<br>
This particular breach was pretty well healed, but the evil survived.<br>
Then came the compromise repeal, wherein the Democracy stood by the<br>
South in casting to the winds, the moment it promised to be of service<br>
to the North, a solemn bargain which had yielded the South Florida,<br>
Arkansas, and Missouri as slave States. Northern Democrats, especially<br>
in the rural parts, unwilling longer to serve slavery, drew off from the<br>
party in increasing numbers. Northern States one by one passed to the<br>
opposition. The whole of New England had gone over in 1856, also New<br>
York, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa--Buchanan having six votes<br>
outside those of Pennsylvania, where he won, as many believed, by unfair<br>
means. In 1860, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Indiana,<br>
Minnesota, and Oregon crossed to the same side.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
THE CRISIS<br>
<br>
[1850]<br>
<br>
The repeal of the Missouri Compromise was politically a remarkable<br>
epoch. It not only consolidated old anti-slavery men, but cooled, to say<br>
the least, many "silvergray," or conservative Whigs, as well as many<br>
"hards" and "hunkers" among the Democrats. But the slavocrats were blind<br>
to the risk they were running, and grew bolder than ever. There were now<br>
propositions for renewing the foreign slave-trade. Worse black laws were<br>
enacted. There was increased ferocity toward all who did not pronounce<br>
slavery a blessing, prouder domineering in politics, especially in<br>
Congress, and perpetual threat of secession in case the slave power<br>
should fail to have its way.<br>
<br>

Brooks. (Only five copies of this photograph were printed.)<br>
<br>
<br>
There were also plans for foreign conquest in slavery's behalf, which<br>
received countenance from public and even from national authorities. The<br>
idea seemed to be that the victory and territorial enlargement<br>
consequent upon the Mexican War might be repeated in Central America and<br>
Cuba. The efforts of Lopez in 1850 and 1851 to conquer Cuba with aid<br>
from the United States had indeed been brought to an end through this<br>
adventurer's execution in the latter year by the Cuban authorities.<br>
Pierce put forth a proclamation in 1854, warning American citizens<br>
against like attempts in future. Defying this, the next year William<br>
Walker headed a filibustering expedition to the Pacific coast of<br>
Nicaragua, conquering the capital of that state and setting up a<br>
government which proceeded to re-establish slavery and invite<br>
immigration from the United States. Driven out by a coalition of other<br>
Central American states against him, Walker at once organized a new<br>
raid, and landed at Punta Arenas, Nicaragua, November 25, 1857; but he<br>
was seized by Commodore Paulding of our navy and brought to New York. He<br>
made a similar effort the next year, and another in 1860, when he<br>
captured Truxillo in Honduras, only to be soon overwhelmed, tried and<br>
shot.<br>
<br>
[1852]<br>
<br>
If the Government at Washington was not openly implicated in any of<br>
these movements, no more, surely, did it heartily deprecate them.<br>
Fillmore's administration had in 1852 declined to enter into an alliance<br>
with Great Britain and France disclaiming intention to secure Cuba. In<br>
1854, inspired by Pierce, our ministers at London, Paris, and Madrid,<br>
met at Ostend and put forth the "Ostend Manifesto." The tenor of this<br>
was that Spain would be better off without Cuba and we with it, and<br>
further, that, if Spain refused to sell, the United States ought as a<br>
means of self-preservation to take that island by force, lest it should<br>
become a second San Domingo. This proposition, like everything else<br>
relating to the great Repeal, was under umbrage in 1856; but in 1858 the<br>
southern Democrats in Congress brought in a bill to purchase Cuba for<br>
$30,000,000, and the democratic platform of 1860 spoke for the<br>
acquisition thereof at the earliest practicable moment, by all<br>
"honorable and just means."<br>
<br>
[1854]<br>
<br>
Thus an institution, barbarous, anti-democratic, sectional, an<br>
unmitigated curse even to its section, not so much as named in the<br>
Constitution, beginning with apology from all, by the zeal and<br>
unscrupulousness of advocates, the consolidation of political power at<br>
the South, and apathy, sycophancy, divided counsels, and commercial<br>
greed in the North, gradually amassed might, till, at the middle of Mr.<br>
Buchanan's term, every branch of the national Government was its tool,<br>
the Supreme Court included, enabling it authoritatively to mis-read the<br>
Constitution, declare the Union a pro-slavery compact, and act<br>
accordingly. But justice would not be mocked, and, though advancing upon<br>
halting foot, dealt the death-blow like lightning at last.<br>
<br>
We have seen the feeble efforts of the old Liberty Party to make head<br>
against slavery, Birney and Earle being its candidates in 1840, Birney<br>
and Morris in 1844. In 1848 these "conscience Free-soilers" were<br>
re-enforced by what have been called the "political Free-soilers" of the<br>
State of New York, led by ex-President Van Buren. This astute organizer,<br>
aware that his defeat in the democratic convention of 1844 had resulted<br>
from southern and pro-slavery influences, led a bolt in the New York<br>
Democracy. His partisans in this were known as the "Barn-burners," while<br>
the administration Democrats were called the "Hunkers." In the<br>
democratic convention of 1848 at Baltimore appeared representatives of<br>
both factions, and both sets were admitted, each with half the state<br>
vote. This satisfied neither side. The Barn-burners called a convention<br>
at Utica in June, and put Van Buren in nomination for the presidency.<br>
The Liberty Party men had the preceding year nominated Hale for this<br>
office, but now, seeing their opportunity, they called a new convention<br>
at Buffalo for August 9, 1848, to which all Free-soilers were invited;<br>
and this convention made Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams its<br>
candidates for President and Vice-President. The platform declared<br>
against any further extension of slavery. The party was henceforth known<br>
as the "Free-soilers," the name coming from its insistence that the<br>
territory conquered from Mexico should forever remain free. Its platform<br>
denounced slavery as a sin against God and a crime against man, and<br>
repudiated the compromise of 1850. It also laid special emphasis upon<br>
the wickedness of the new fugitive slave law, of which it demanded the<br>
repeal. By 1852 the regular Democracy in New York had won back a large<br>
proportion of the Barn-burners or free-soil revolters, so that the<br>
free-soil prospect in this year was not encouraging. Only 146,149<br>
free-soil votes were polled in all the northern states.<br>
<br>
[1856]<br>
<br>
What quickened this drooping movement into new and triumphant life was<br>
the revocation of the Missouri Compromise. This rallied to the free-soil<br>
standard nearly all the northern Whigs, many old Barn-burners who since<br>
1848 had returned to the democratic fold, and vast numbers of other<br>
anti-Lecompton Democrats. Most of the Know-nothings throughout the North<br>
also joined it, while of course it had in all its anti-slavery measures<br>
the hearty co-operation, directly political or other, of the<br>
Abolitionists. The first national convention of this new party,<br>
fortunately styling itself "Republican," was in 1856. Whig doctrine<br>
early appeared in the party by the demand for protection, internal<br>
improvements, and a national banking system; in fact, Republicanism may<br>
be said to have received nearly entire the whig mantle, as the Whigs did<br>
that of Federalism.<br>
<br>
But the living soul and integrating idea of the party was new, the rigid<br>
confinement of slavery and the slave power to their narrowest<br>
constitutional limits. It denounced the repeal of the Missouri<br>
Compromise. In the election of this year, 1856, eleven States chose<br>
Republican electors, viz.: all New England, also New York, Ohio,<br>
Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Evidently the Democracy had at last found<br>
a foe at which it were best not to sneer. The Dred Scott decision<br>
immensely aided the growth of this new political power, as it was now<br>
quite generally believed in the North that the whole policy of the South<br>
was a greedy, selfish grasping for the extension of slavery.<br>
<br>
[1858]<br>
<br>
Out of this conviction, apparently, grew the John Brown raid into<br>
Virginia in 1858. John Brown was an enthusiast, whom sufferings from the<br>
Border Ruffians in Kansas, where one of his sons had been atrociously<br>
murdered and another driven to insanity by cruel treatment as a<br>
prisoner, had frenzied in his opposition to slavery. He had dedicated<br>
himself to its extirpation. The intrepid old man formed the purpose of<br>
invading Virginia, and of placing himself with a few white allies at the<br>
head of a slave insurrection that should sweep the State.&nbsp; Friends
in<br>
the North had contributed money for the purchase of arms, and on October<br>
16th, Brown, with fourteen white men and four negroes, seized the United<br>
States Armory at Harper's Ferry. He stopped the railway trains, freed<br>
some slaves, and assumed to rule the town. United States troops were at<br>
once despatched to the scene, when the misguided hero, with his devoted<br>
band, fortified themselves in the engine house, surrendering only after<br>
thirteen of them, including two of Brown's sons, were killed or mortally<br>
wounded. Brown and the other survivors were soon tried, convicted, and<br>
hung. This insane attempt was deprecated by nearly all of all parties;<br>
but the fate of Brown, with his resolute bravery, begot him large<br>
sympathy, and the false assumption of the South that he really<br>
represented northern feeling made his deed helpful to the anti-slavery<br>
movement, of which the Republican Party was now the centre.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
[1860]<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding all this the Democracy might still have elected a<br>
president in 1860 had it been united. But it was now desperately at feud<br>
with itself, the cause of this, beautifully enough, lying back in that<br>
very device of Repeal which was intended to make Kansas a slave State<br>
and so to perpetuate the democratic sway. Judge Douglas, and most of the<br>
northern Democrats with him, had insisted so long and earnestly upon the<br>
doctrine of squatter sovereignty that they could not now possibly recede<br>
from it even had they desired to do so. The great majority of them did<br>
not so desire, but sincerely believed in that doctrine as part and<br>
parcel of the true democratic faith. But it was now obvious that the<br>
working out of the Douglas theory was absolutely sure to make free all<br>
the western States henceforth to be formed. This would, of course,<br>
remove the Senate from the domination of slavery. Hence the South was<br>
irrevocably opposed to it, and insisted with all its might upon the<br>
Calhoun-Taney contention that the national Government must protect<br>
slavery in all the Territories to which it pleased to go. In a passage<br>
at arms with Douglas as they were stumping Illinois for the senatorship<br>
in 1858, Lincoln keenly forced upon him the question whether under the<br>
Dred Scott decision any Territory could possibly be kept free from<br>
slavery. "If," said he, "Douglas answers yes, he can never be President;<br>
if no, Illinois will not again elect him senator." Douglas replied in<br>
the affirmative, and, as his antagonist prophesied, became in the South<br>
a doomed man.<br>
<br>
The schism was fully apparent when, on April 23d, the democratic<br>
convention of 1860 began its session in Charleston. A majority of the<br>
delegates were for Douglas, voting down the Calhoun-Taney view, though<br>
willing that the party should bind itself to obey the Dred Scott<br>
decision. When the Douglas platform was adopted the delegations from<br>
Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas, with parts of those from<br>
Louisiana, North and South Carolina, Arkansas, and Delaware, seceded.<br>
Douglas had a majority vote as presidential candidate, but not<br>
two-thirds. The convention adjourned to meet at Baltimore June 18th, and<br>
when it met there Douglas was nominated by the requisite two-thirds<br>
vote. The seceders met at Richmond, June 11th, where, imitating some new<br>
seceders at Baltimore they nominated Breckenridge and Lane. The<br>
so-called Constitutional Union Party also had in the field its ticket,<br>
Bell and Everett, which secured votes from a few persistent Whigs and<br>
Know-nothings still foolish enough to suppose that further clash between<br>
the powers of slavery and freedom could somehow be averted.<br>
<br>
The Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, and Hannibal<br>
Hamlin, of Maine. Lincoln was already a marked man in his party,<br>
especially in the West, his brilliant joint debate with Judge Douglas<br>
during some months in 1858 having brought out his matchless good sense<br>
and good nature, his rare knowledge of our history and law, and his high<br>
quality as thinker and speaker. Born in Kentucky in 1809, removing to<br>
Indiana in 1816, to Illinois in 1830, reared in extreme poverty and<br>
wholly self-educated, this man had risen by his wits, his sturdy<br>
perseverance and industry, his extraordinary ability, and his proverbial<br>
honesty, to be the acknowledged peer of the "Little Giant" himself. He<br>
began political life a Whig and ably represented that party in the<br>
national Congress from 1847 to 1849, making his voice heard against the<br>
high-handed procedure of the Administration in the Mexican War. But as<br>
with Seward, Greeley, Fessenden, Thaddeus Stevens, Sherman, Dayton,<br>
Corwin, and Collamer, subsequent events had intensified his anti-slavery<br>
feeling, convincing him, as he avowed, that the Union could not<br>
"permanently continue half slave and half free." He was thus drawn to<br>
unite his fortunes with the Republicans. His nomination was received<br>
coolly in the East, where Seward had been preferred; but as men studied<br>
Lincoln's record they were convinced of the wisdom which had made him<br>
the party's leader. He swept New England, New York, New Jersey,<br>
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin,<br>
California, Minnesota, and Oregon, having 180 electoral votes to<br>
Breckenridge's 72, Bell's 39, and Douglas's 12.<br>

CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
MATERIAL PROGRESS<br>
<br>
[1860]<br>
<br>
The population of the United States in 1860 was 31,443,321. In spite of<br>
the threatening political complications between 1840 and 1860, these<br>
years were characterized by astonishing economic prosperity. The decade<br>
after 1848 was, indeed, in point of advance in material weal, the golden<br>
age of our history. Between 1850 and 1860, the wealth of the nation<br>
swelled 120 per cent., the value of its farms 103 per cent., its total<br>
manufacturing product 87 per cent., its manufactured export 171 per<br>
cent., its railroad mileage 220 per cent. Making all due allowance for<br>
the rise of prices during the period, this is still a remarkable<br>
exhibit.<br>
<br>
The great West continued to come under the hand of civilization. Between<br>
1850 and 1860 our centre of population made a longer stride westward<br>
than during any other decade--from east of the meridian of Parkersburg,<br>
W. Va., to the meridian of Chillicothe, O. Florida and Texas having been<br>
admitted to statehood in 1845, Iowa followed next year, Wisconsin in<br>
1848, California in 1850, Minnesota, which had been an organized<br>
Territory since 1849, in 1858, and Oregon in 1859. Kansas, Nebraska,<br>
Utah, and Washington Territories were organized before 1860. By this<br>
date there were settlements far up the Rio Grande. The Pacific coast was<br>
sought for lands and homes as well as for gold. Fremont's expeditions in<br>
1842, 1844, and 1848 had done much to show people the way thither. In<br>
1853 the Government sent out four different parties to survey suitable<br>
routes for a Pacific railway, a work followed up by three other parties<br>
the next summer. The settlements in Oregon had, by 1845, in places<br>
become dense.<br>

Immigration hither was unfortunately checked a little later by Indian<br>
hostilities, the gravest attacks being in 1847 and 1855. In the latter<br>
year Major Haller, leading an exploring party, was surrounded by the<br>
savages and cut off from food and water, only making his escape by a<br>
fight of two days against overwhelming odds. He and his party at last<br>
hewed their desperate way through, losing their entire outfit, besides<br>
one-fifth of their number. The whole territory was harassed by Indians<br>
on the war path, and General Wool had to be sent up from San Francisco<br>
to restore peace. This done, immigration was renewed. A thousand new<br>
inhabitants came to Oregon in 1852, and its northern half was organized<br>
as Washington Territory the following year. The Pacific Mail Steamship<br>
Company had been chartered in 1848, and four years earlier a newspaper<br>
started, the first in English on that coast. Its seat was Oregon City,<br>
its name the Flumgudgeon Gazette.<br>

<br>
<br>
The old West prospered, notwithstanding the drain which it, in common<br>
with the East, experienced in favor of parts farther toward the setting<br>
sun. The first lake propeller was launched at Cleveland in 1847. The<br>
same year the Tribune was started in Chicago. In 1850 the city had its<br>
theatre and its board of trade. The Chicago streets began this year to<br>
be lighted with gas. The first bridge across the Mississippi was built<br>
in 1855 at Minneapolis; that at Rock Island, 1,582 feet long, in 1856.<br>
The Niagara suspension bridge was finished in 1855.<br>
<br>
The increase of railways did not at once end the opening of canals. The<br>
Miami Canal, between Cincinnati and Toledo, 215 miles, begun in 1825,<br>
was finished in 1843, and the Wabash and Erie, between Evansville and<br>
Toledo, opened in 1851; but the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts was, in<br>
1853, abandoned and filled up from the loss of its business to<br>
railroads. In 1857 the Pennsylvania Railroad Company purchased from the<br>
State the canal and railway line from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, and<br>
soon after extended the railway portion to cover the whole. A traveller<br>
from Boston to the West could get to Rochester by rail in 1841. Next<br>
year he could go on to Buffalo by the same means. In 1842, Augusta, Ga.,<br>
was connected by rail with Atlanta, Savannah with Macon, and the Boston<br>
&amp; Maine Railway finished to Berwick.<br>

The first railway out of Chicago--it was the first in Illinois--was<br>
built in 1850, to Elgin. Chicago had no railway connection with the East<br>
till two years later, when the Michigan Southern was opened. The<br>
Michigan Central was finished soon after the Southern, and the Rock<br>
Island before the end of the year. The Michigan Central had direct<br>
connection east across Canada to Niagara Falls by 1854. In 1856 the<br>
Burlington route reached the Mississippi and the Rock Island went on to<br>
Iowa City. This year witnessed the opening of the first railroad in<br>
California--from Sacramento to Folsom. In 1857 Chicago and St. Louis<br>
were joined by rails, as also the latter city with Baltimore, over the<br>
Parkersburg branch of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio.<br>

<br>
We now come to an improvement of which the preceding period knew<br>
nothing, the magnetic telegraph, introduced by Professor Morse in 1844.<br>
In this year Morse secured a congressional appropriation of $30,000 for<br>
a line from Washington to Baltimore. The wires were at first encased in<br>
tubes underground. In spite of the success of the project, further<br>
governmental patronage was refused, the Postmaster-General advising<br>
against it under the conviction that the invention could not become<br>
practically valuable. Morse appealed for aid from private capitalists.<br>
Ezra Cornell, of New York, soon opened a short line in Boston for<br>
exhibition, following this with a similar enterprise in New York City.<br>
The admission fee was twelve and a half cents. Few cared to pay even<br>
this trifle, so that the undertaking was hardly a success in either<br>
city.<br>
<br>
Amos Kendall then engaged as Morse's agent, and by dint of great effort<br>
secured subscriptions for a line from New York to Philadelphia, being<br>
obliged to sell the shares for one-half their face value. Incorporation<br>
was secured from the Maryland Legislature, under the first American<br>
charter, for the telegraph business. The line was completed in 1845 to<br>
the Hudson opposite the upper end of Manhattan Island, and an effort<br>
made to insulate the wire and connect with the city along the bottom of<br>
the river. This failed, and for some time messages had to be taken over<br>
in boats. In 1846 the wire was carried on to Baltimore. In the same year<br>
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were connected by telegraph, New York and<br>
Albany, New York and Boston, Boston and Buffalo. The first line in<br>
California was erected in 1853.<br>

<br>
In 1850 Hiram Sibley embarked in the telegraph business. He bought the<br>
House patent, and next year organized the New York and Mississippi<br>
Valley Telegraph Company. By 1853 or 1854, some twenty companies had<br>
started, with a capital of&nbsp; $7,000,000--too many for good
management or<br>
high profits. Accordingly, Sibley and Cornell united in buying them up,<br>
and thus formed, in 1856, the Western Union, which Sibley's energy<br>
extended all over the country east of the Rocky Mountains. In 1860 he<br>
went to Washington with a scheme for a transcontinental telegraph line,<br>
and secured from Congress a subsidy of $40,000 for ten years. Just then<br>
the Overland Telegraph Company was started in San Francisco. It and<br>
Sibley united, breaking ground July 1, 1861, and proceeding at the rate<br>
of nearly ten miles of wire per day. On October 25th, telegraph wire<br>
stretched all the way between the two oceans. In 1864 this line was<br>
amalgamated with the Western Union.<br>
<br>

Sheets or upon Cloth, called the "Chaffee Machine."<br>
<br>
<br>
Still more wonderful, ocean telegraphy was broached and made successful<br>
during these years. Tentative efforts to operate the current under water<br>
were made between Governor's Island and New York City so early as 1842.<br>
A copper wire was used, insulated with hemp string coated with India<br>
rubber and pitch. In 1846 a similar arrangement was encased in lead<br>
pipe. This device failed, and sub-aqueous telegraphy seems to have been<br>
for the time given up.<br>
<br>
In 1854 Mr. Cyrus W. Field, of New York, with Peter Cooper and other<br>
capitalists of that city, organized the New York, Newfoundland, and<br>
London Telegraph Company, stock a million and a half dollars, and began<br>
plans to connect New York with St. Johns, Newfoundland, by a cable under<br>
the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Little progress was made, however, till 1857,<br>
when it was attempted to lay a cable across the Atlantic from<br>
Newfoundland. The paying out was begun at Queenstown and proceeded<br>
successfully until three hundred and thirty-five miles had been laid,<br>
when the cable parted. Nothing more was done till the next year in June.<br>
Then, in 1858, after several more unsuccessful efforts, the two<br>
continents were successfully joined. The two ships containing the cable<br>
met in mid-ocean, where it was spliced and the paying out begun in each<br>
direction. The one reached Newfoundland the same day, August 5th, on<br>
which the other reached Valencia, Ireland. No break had occurred, and<br>
after the necessary arrangements had been effected, the first message<br>
was transmitted on August 16th. It was from the Queen of Great Britain<br>
to the President of the United States, and read, "Glory to God in the<br>
highest, peace on earth and good will to men." A monster celebration of<br>
the event was had in New York next day.<br>

<br>
Although inter-continental communication had been actually opened, the<br>
cable did not work, nor did ocean cabling become a successful and<br>
regular business till 1866, when a new cable was laid. This event<br>
attracted the more attention from the fact that the largest ship ever<br>
built was used in paying out the cable. It was the Great Eastern, 680<br>
feet long and 83 broad, with 25,000 tons displacement.<br>

<br>
Street railways became common in our largest cities before 1860, the<br>
first in New England, that between Boston and Cambridge, dating from<br>
1856. Sleeping-cars began to be used in 1858. The express business went<br>
on developing, being opened westward from Buffalo first in 1845. A steam<br>
fire-engine was tried in New York in 1841, but the invention was<br>
successful only in 1853. Baltimore used one in 1858. Goodyear<br>
triumphantly vulcanized rubber in 1844, making serviceable a gum which<br>
had been used in various forms already but without ability to stand<br>
heat. Elias Howe took out his first patent for a sewing machine in 1846,<br>
being kept in vigorous fight against infringements for the next eight<br>
years. The anaesthetic power of ether was discovered in 1844.<br>
Gutta-percha was first imported hither in 1847. The first application of<br>
the Bessemer steel process in this country was made in New Jersey in<br>
1856, the manufacture of watches by machinery begun in 1857,<br>
photo-lithography in 1859. New York had a clearing house in 1853, Boston<br>
in 1855. The petroleum business may with propriety be dated from 1860,<br>
although the existence of oil in Northwestern Pennsylvania had been long<br>
known, and some use made of it since 1826. For several years experiments<br>
had been making in refining the oil. The excellence of the light from it<br>
now drew attention to the value of the product, wells began to be bored<br>
and oil land sold for fabulous prices.<br>

We close this chapter with a word about the painful financial crisis<br>
that swept over the country in the autumn of 1857. Its causes are<br>
somewhat occult, but two appear to have been the chief, viz., the<br>
over-rapid building of railroads and the speculation induced by the<br>
prosperity and the rise of prices incident to the new output of gold.<br>
Interest on the best securities rose to three, four, and five per cent.<br>
a month. On ordinary securities no money at all could be had. Commercial<br>
houses of the highest repute went down. The climax was in September and<br>
October. The three leading banks in Philadelphia suspended specie<br>
payments, at once followed in this by all the banks of the Middle<br>
States, and upon the 13th of the next month by the New York banks.<br>
Manufacturing was very largely abandoned for the time, at least thirty<br>
thousand operatives being thrown out of work in New York City alone.<br>
Prices even of agricultural produce fell enormously. Tramps were to be<br>
met on every road. Easier times fortunately returned by spring, when<br>
business resumed pretty nearly its former prosperous march.<br>

<br>
CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION<br>
<br>
1860-1868<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
CAUSES OF THE WAR<br>
<br>
[1861]<br>
<br>
It were a mistake to refer the great Rebellion, for ultimate source, to<br>
ambiguity in the Constitution or to the wickedness of politicians or of<br>
the people. It was simply the last resort in an "irrepressible conflict"<br>
of principle--in the struggle for and against the genius of the world's<br>
advance. Economic, social, and moral evolution, resulting in two<br>
radically different civilizations, had enforced upon each section<br>
unfaithfulness to the spirit and even to the letter of its<br>
constitutional covenant. The South was not to blame that slavery was at<br>
first profitable; and if it deemed it so too long and even thought of it<br>
as a good morally, these convictions, however big with ill consequences<br>
to the nation, were but errors of view, not strange considering the then<br>
status of slavery in the world.<br>
<br>
The South's pride, holding it to the course once chosen, was also no<br>
indictable offence. Nor could the North on its part be taxed with crime<br>
for its "higher law fanaticism," which was simply the spirit of the age;<br>
or for seeing early what all believe now, that slavery was a blight upon<br>
the land. Much as was "nominated in the bond" of the Constitution,<br>
neither law nor equity forbade free States to increase the more rapidly<br>
in numbers, wealth, and other elements of prosperity; and northern<br>
congressmen must have been other than human, if, seeing this increase<br>
and being in the majority, they had gone on punctiliously heeding formal<br>
obligation against manifest national weal. And when, in 1854, the great<br>
sacred compact of 1820 was set aside by the authority of the South<br>
itself, the North felt free even from formal fetters. All talk of<br>
extra-legal negotiations and understandings touching slavery was now at<br>
an end. The northern majority was at last united to legislate upon<br>
slavery as it would, subject only to the Constitution. The South too<br>
late saw this, and fearing that the peculiar institution, shut up to its<br>
old home, would die, sought separation, with such chance of expansion as<br>
this might yield.<br>
<br>
The South had come to love slavery too well, the Constitution too<br>
little. Upon conserving slavery all parties there, however dissident as<br>
to modes, however hostile in other matters, were unconditionally bent.<br>
The chief argument even of those opposing disunion was that it<br>
endangered slavery. Our new government, said Alexander H. Stephens, soon<br>
to be vice-president of the Southern Confederacy, is founded, its<br>
cornerstone rests, upon the great physical, philosophical, and moral<br>
truth, to which Jefferson and the men of his day were blind, that the<br>
negro, by nature or the curse of Canaan, is not equal to the white man;<br>
that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is, by ordination of<br>
Providence, whose wisdom it is not for us to inquire into or question,<br>
his natural and normal condition. As the apostle of such a principle the<br>
South could not but abjure the old establishment, whose genius and<br>
working were inevitably in the contrary direction. Many confessed it to<br>
be the essential nature of our Government, and not unfair treatment<br>
under it, against which they rebelled.<br>
<br>
Slavery had also bred hatred of the Union indirectly, by fostering<br>
anti-democratic habits of thought, feeling, and action. "The form of<br>
liberty existed, the press seemed to be free, the deliberations of<br>
legislative bodies were tumultuous, and every man boasted of his<br>
independence. But the spirit of true liberty, tolerance of the minority<br>
and respect for individual opinion, had departed, and those deceitful<br>
appearances concealed the despotism of an inexorable master, slavery,<br>
before whom the most powerful of slave-holders was himself but a slave,<br>
as abject as the meanest." Over wide sections, untitled manorial lords,<br>
"more intelligent than educated, brave but irascible, proud but<br>
overbearing," controlled all voting and office-holding. Congressional<br>
districts were their pocket-boroughs, and they ignored the common man<br>
save to use him. The system grew, instead of statesmen, sectionalists,<br>
whom love for the "peculiar institution" rendered callous to national<br>
interests.<br>
<br>
The vigorous secession movements in the South at once after Lincoln's<br>
election, raised a question of the first magnitude, which few people at<br>
the North had reflected upon since 1833, viz., whether or not<br>
non-revolutionary secession was possible. Almost unanimously the North<br>
denied such possibility, the South affirmed it. This was at bottom<br>
manifestly nothing but the old question of state sovereignty over again.<br>
The South held the Union to be a state compact, which the northern<br>
parties thereto had broken. To prove the compact theory no new proof was<br>
now adduced. Rather did the southern people take the assertion of it as<br>
an axiom, with a simplicity which spoke volumes for the influence of<br>
Calhoun and for the indoctrination which the South had received in 1832.<br>
<br>
Not alone Calhoun but nearly every other southerner of great influence,<br>
at least from the day of the Missouri Compromise, had been inculcating<br>
the supreme authority of the State as compared with the Union. The<br>
southern States were all large, and, as travelling in or between them<br>
was difficult and little common, they retained far more than those at<br>
the North each its original separateness and peculiarities. Southern<br>
population was more fixed than northern; southern state traditions were<br>
held in far the deeper reverence. In a word, the colonial condition of<br>
things to a great extent persisted in the South down to the very days of<br>
the war. There was every reason why Alabama or North Carolina should,<br>
more than Connecticut, feel like a separate nation.<br>
<br>
This intense state consciousness might gradually have subsided but for<br>
the deep prejudices and passions begotten of slavery and of the<br>
opposition it encountered from the North. Their resolution, against<br>
emancipation led Southerners to cherish a view which made it seem<br>
possible for them as a last resort to sever their alliance with the<br>
North. It was this conjunction of influences, linking the slave-holder's<br>
jealousy and pride to a false but natural conception of state<br>
sovereignty, which created in southern men that love of State, intense<br>
and sincere as real patriotism, causing them to look upon northern men,<br>
with their different theory, as foes and foreigners.<br>
<br>
A very imposing historical argument could of course have been built up<br>
for the Calhoun theory of the Union. The Union emerged from the<br>
preceding Confederacy without a shock. Most who voted for it were<br>
unaware how radical a change it embodied. The Constitution, one may even<br>
admit, could not have been adopted had it then been understood to<br>
preclude the possibility of secession. Doubtless, too, the gradual<br>
change of view concerning it all over the North, sprung from the<br>
multiplication of social and economic ties between sections and States,<br>
rather than from study of constitutional law. We believe that the<br>
untruth of the central-sovereignty theory in no wise follows from these<br>
admissions, and that its correctness might be made apparent from a<br>
plenitude of considerations.<br>
<br>
Champions of the northern side deemed it the less necessary to expatiate<br>
upon this question, since, admitting the South's basal contention, the<br>
right in question depended upon sufficiency of grievance. As, in the<br>
South's view, the case was one of sovereigns one party of whom, without<br>
referee, was about to break a compact without the other's consent, the<br>
adequacy of the grievance should, to excuse the step, have been<br>
absolutely beyond question. On the contrary it was subject to the<br>
gravest question.<br>
<br>
The South's only significant indictment against the North was the one<br>
concerning the personal liberty laws. Moderates like Stephens, indeed,<br>
stoutly condemned this plea for secession as insufficient; but,<br>
believing in the State as sovereign, they had perforce to yield, and<br>
they became as enthusiastic as any when once this "paramount authority"<br>
had spoken. "Fire-eaters," at first a small minority, saw this advantage<br>
and worked it to the utmost. On its complaint touching the personal<br>
liberty legislation the South's case utterly broke down, theorizing the<br>
Union into a rope of sand, not "more perfect" but far less so than the<br>
old, which itself was to be "perpetual." According to the Calhoun<br>
contention States were the parties to a pact, and it was a good way from<br>
clear that any northern State as such, even by personal liberty<br>
legislation, had broken the alleged pact. The liberty laws were innocent<br>
at least in form, and at worst had never been endorsed in any state<br>
convention. Buchanan himself testified that the fugitive slave law had<br>
been faithfully executed, and its operation is well known never to have<br>
been resisted by any public authority.<br>
<br>
It was suspicious that no State ventured upon secession alone. It was<br>
equally remarkable that the Gulf States were the readiest to go, and<br>
made most of the personal liberty laws as their pretext, accounting this<br>
cry, as was ingenuously confessed, a necessary means for holding the<br>
border States solidly to the southern cause. Weak enough, indeed, was<br>
the complaint of&nbsp; "consolidationist" aggression, of which
certainly no<br>
party to the so-called pact was or could have been guilty. But the deeps<br>
of folly were sounded when northern "persecution" of the South was<br>
mentioned, or Lincoln's election as threat of such. This was simply the<br>
election as President, in a perfectly constitutional way, of a citizen,<br>
honest and unambitious, who was pledged against touching slavery in<br>
States. Having become President, he was unable to procure minister, law,<br>
treaty, or even adequate guard for his own person save by the consent of<br>
the party hitherto in power. Lincoln had failed of a popular majority by<br>
a million. Both Houses of Congress were against him at the time of his<br>
election, and, but for the absence of southern members, they would, it<br>
is likely, have continued so through his entire term. It was the South's<br>
bad logic on these points which gave the war Democrats their excellent<br>
plea for drawing sword on the northern side.<br>
<br>
But even supposing secession technically justifiable, how strange that<br>
it should have been judged rational, prudent, or in the long run best<br>
for the South itself. Could aught but frenzy have so drowned in<br>
Americans the memories of our great past; or launched them upon a course<br>
that must have ended by Mexicanizing this nation, wresting from it the<br>
lead in freedom's march, and crushing out, in the breast of struggling<br>
patriotism the world over, all hope of government by and for the people!<br>
The South ought at least to have spared itself. Either its alleged<br>
horror at the advance of central-sovereignty sentiment at the North was<br>
sheer pretence, or it should have been certain that this section would<br>
not hesitate, as Buchanan so illogically did, to coerce "rebellious"<br>
state-bodies. If the North believed the totality of the nation to be the<br>
"paramount authority," Lincoln would surely imitate Jackson instead of<br>
Buchanan, and in doing so he would not seek military support in vain.<br>

<br>
Quite as sure, too, must the final result have appeared from the census<br>
of 1850, had people been calm enough to read this. By that census the<br>
free States had a population fifty per cent. above the population of the<br>
slave states, slaves included, and the disparity was rapidly increasing.<br>
Their wealth was even more preponderant, being, slaves apart, nearly one<br>
hundred per cent. the larger. Their merchant tonnage was five times the<br>
greater--even young inland Ohio out-doing old South Carolina in this,<br>
and the one district of New York City the whole South. The North had<br>
three or four times the South's miles of railway, all the sinews of war<br>
without importation, and mechanics unnumbered and of every sort. And<br>
while champions of the Union would fight with all the prestige of law,<br>
national history and the status quo on their side, Europe's aid to the<br>
South, or even that of the border slave States, was more than<br>
problematical, as was a successful career for the Confederacy in case<br>
its independence should chance to be won. Events proved that the very<br>
defence of slavery had best prospect in the Union, and it seems as if<br>
this might have been foreseen by all, as it actually was by some.<br>
<br>

<br>
CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
SECESSION<br>
<br>
[1861]<br>
<br>
Secession was no new thought at the South. It lurked darkly behind the<br>
Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 1798-99. It was brought out into<br>
broad daylight by South Carolina in the nullification troubles of 1832.<br>
"Texas or disunion!" was the cry at the South in 1843-44. In 1850 South<br>
Carolina declared herself ready to secede in the event of legislation<br>
hostile to slavery. Two years later the same State solemnly affirmed<br>
that it had a right to secede, but that, out of deference to the wishes<br>
of the other slave States, it forbore to exercise such right.<br>
<br>
It must be admitted that in early years the North had helped to make the<br>
thought of secession familiar. In 1803, in view of the great increase of<br>
southern territory by the Louisiana Purchase, and again in 1813, when<br>
New England opposition to the war with England culminated in the<br>
Hartford Convention, there had been talk of a separate northern<br>
confederacy. But from that time on the thought of disunion died out at<br>
the North, while the South dallied with it more and more boldly. During<br>
the presidential campaign of 1856, threats were made that if Fremont,<br>
the republican candidate, should be elected, the South would leave the<br>
Union. In October of that year a secret convention of southern governors<br>
was held at Raleigh, N. C., supposed to have been for the purpose of<br>
considering such a contingency. Governor Wise, of Virginia, who called<br>
the convention, afterward proclaimed that had Fremont been chosen he<br>
would have marched to Washington at the head of 20,000 troops, seized<br>
the Capitol, and prevented the inauguration. This threatening attitude<br>
in 1856 may have been chiefly an electioneering device; but during the<br>
next four years the gulf between North and South widened rapidly, and<br>
the southern leaders turned more and more resolutely toward secession as<br>
the remedy for their alleged wrongs.<br>
<br>
No sooner had the presidential campaign of 1860 begun than deep<br>
mutterings foretold the coming storm. "Elect Lincoln, and the South will<br>
secede!" cried the campaign orators of the South, while the halls of<br>
Congress rang with threats similar in tenor. As the campaign went on and<br>
republican success became probable, the southern leaders began to nerve<br>
up their hosts for the conflict. In October the governor and congressmen<br>
of South Carolina, with other prominent politicians, met and unanimously<br>
resolved that if Lincoln should win, the Palmetto State ought to<br>
renounce the Union. Similar meetings were held in Georgia, Alabama,<br>
Mississippi, and Florida. Governor Gist sent a confidential circular to<br>
the governors of all the cotton States declaring that South Carolina<br>
would secede with any other State, or would make the plunge alone if<br>
others would promise to follow. The governors of Florida, Alabama, and<br>
Mississippi replied that their States would certainly do this. Georgia<br>
proposed to wait for some overt act by the National Government. North<br>
Carolina and Louisiana, it was learned, would probably not go out at<br>
all.<br>
<br>
But the enthusiasts in South Carolina had got all the encouragement they<br>
wanted, and bided their time. Their time was at hand. The presidential<br>
election fell on November 6th. Next day the tidings flashed over the<br>
land that Abraham Lincoln had been elected President by the vote of a<br>
solid North against a solid South. The wires had scarcely ceased to<br>
thrill with this message of death to slavery-extension, when South<br>
Carolina sounded a trumpet-call to the South. Her Legislature ordered a<br>
secession state convention to meet in December, issued a call for 10,000<br>
volunteers, and voted money for the purchase of arms. Federal<br>
office-holders resigned. Judge Magrath, of the United States District<br>
Court, laid aside his robes, declaring, "So far as I am concerned, the<br>
temple of Justice raised under the Constitution of the United States is<br>
now closed." Militia organized throughout the State. The streets of<br>
Charleston echoed nightly with the tramp of drilling minute-men.<br>
Secession orators harangued enthusiastic crowds. Hardly a coat but bore<br>
a secession cockade. November 17th, the Palmetto flag was unfurled in<br>
Charleston. It was a gala day. Cannon roared, bands played the<br>
Marseillaise, and processions paraded the streets bearing such mottoes<br>
as "Let's Bury the Union's Dead Carcass!" "Death to All Abolitionists!"<br>
The whole South was beside itself with excitement. One State after<br>
another assembled its convention to decide the question of secession.<br>
Even the Georgia Legislature, within a week after the election of<br>
Lincoln, voted $1,000,000 to arm the State.<br>
<br>
The South Carolina convention met at Charleston, and on December 20th<br>
unanimously adopted an ordinance declaring:<br>
<br>
"The union now subsisting between South Carolina and other States, under<br>
the name of the United States of America, is hereby dissolved."<br>
<br>
This action was hailed with wildest enthusiasm. Huge placards--"The<br>
Union is Dissolved!"--were posted throughout the city, while the clang<br>
of bells and the boom of cannon notified the country round. The<br>
sidewalks were thronged with ladies wearing secession bonnets made of<br>
cotton with palmetto decorations. A party of gentlemen visited the tomb<br>
of Calhoun, and there registered their vows to defend the southern cause<br>
with their fortunes and lives. In the evening the convention marched to<br>
the hall in procession, and formally signed the revolutionary ordinance.<br>
The chairman then solemnly proclaimed South Carolina an "independent<br>
commonwealth." The little State, whose white population was less than<br>
300,000, began to play at being a nation. The governor was authorized to<br>
appoint a cabinet and receive foreign ambassadors, and the papers put<br>
information from other parts of the country under the head of "foreign<br>
news."<br>
<br>
<br>

Carolina 1776-1860"<br>
<br>
<br>
The secession of South Carolina was greeted with joy in most of the<br>
other slave States. Montgomery and Mobile, Ala., each fired one hundred<br>
guns. At Richmond, Va., a palmetto banner was unfurled, while bells,<br>
bonfires, and processions celebrated the event all over the South. The<br>
other cotton States, spurred on by the bold deed of South Carolina,<br>
rapidly followed her lead. Mississippi seceded January 9th, Florida the<br>
10th, Alabama the 11th, Georgia the 19th, Louisiana the 26th, Texas<br>
February 1st.<br>
<br>
It is probable that only in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida<br>
were the majority of whites in favor of secession. The South was after<br>
all full of Union sentiment. The ordinance of secession proceeded in<br>
each State from a convention, and the election of delegates to this<br>
witnessed the earnest work. The noble efforts of those Union men in<br>
their fierce struggle have never yet been appreciated. But they fought<br>
against great odds, and were inevitably overborne. The opposition was<br>
organized, ably led, and white-hot with zeal. The political power and<br>
the wealth of the South lay in the hands of the secessionists. The<br>
clergy threw their weight on that side, preaching that slavery, God's<br>
ordinance, was in danger. Union proclivities were crushed out by force.<br>
Vigilance committees were everywhere on the alert. In the rougher States<br>
of the Southwest abolitionists were tarred and feathered. Some were<br>
shot. In all the States Union men were warned to keep quiet or leave the<br>
South. One of the most powerful agents of intimidation was the Knights<br>
of the Golden Circle, a vast secret society which extended throughout<br>
the southern States.<br>
<br>
Yet, in spite of all, the vote was close even in several of the cotton<br>
States. The Georgia people wanted new safeguards for slavery, but did<br>
not at first desire secession. Alexander H. Stephens, who headed the<br>
anti-secession movement, declared that Georgia was won over to take the<br>
fatal step at last only by the cry, "Better terms can be made out of the<br>
Union than in it." Even then the first vote for secession stood only 165<br>
to 130. In Louisiana the popular vote for convention delegates was<br>
20,000 for secession and 17,000 against.<br>
<br>
The border States held aloof. Kentucky and Tennessee refused to call<br>
conventions. So, for long, did North Carolina. The convention of<br>
Virginia and of Missouri each had a majority of Union delegates. When<br>
the Confederate Government was organized in February, only seven of the<br>
fifteen slave States had seceded. Their white population was about<br>
2,600,000, or less than half that of the entire slave region. But<br>
Arkansas and North Carolina were soon swept along by the current, and<br>
seceded in May. Virginia and Tennessee were finally carried (the former<br>
in May, the latter in June) by the aid of troops, who swarmed in from<br>
the seceded States, and turned the elections into a farce. Unionists in<br>
the Virginia Convention were given the choice to vote secession, leave,<br>
or be hanged. Missouri, Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland resisted all<br>
attempts to drag them into the Confederacy, though the first two, after<br>
the United States began to apply force, appeared neutral rather than<br>
loyal.<br>
<br>
The seizure of United States property went hand in hand with secession.<br>
Most of the government works were feebly garrisoned, and made no<br>
resistance. By January 15th the secessionists had possession of arsenals<br>
at Augusta, Ga., Mount Vernon, Ala., Fayetteville, N. C, Chattahoochee,<br>
Fla., and Baton Rouge, La., of forts in Alabama and Georgia, of a<br>
navy-yard at Pensacola, Fla., and of Forts Jackson and St. Philip,<br>
commanding the mouth of the Mississippi. At one arsenal they found<br>
150,000 pounds of powder, at another 22,000 muskets and rifles, besides<br>
ammunition and cannon, at another 50,000 small arms and 20 heavy guns.<br>
The whole South had been well supplied with military stores by the<br>
enterprising foresight of J. B. Floyd, of Virginia, Buchanan's Secretary<br>
of War, who had sent thither 115,000 muskets from the Springfield<br>
arsenal alone.<br>
<br>

Major Robert Anderson.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fort Moultrie, in Charleston harbor, was held by Major Robert Anderson,<br>
of Kentucky, with a garrison of some seventy men. On December 27th the<br>
whole country was thrilled, and the South enraged, by the news that on<br>
the previous night Anderson had secretly transferred his whole force to<br>
Fort Sumter, a new and stronger work in the centre of the harbor,<br>
leaving spiked cannon and burning gun-carriages behind him at Moultrie.<br>
The South Carolina militia at once occupied the deserted fortress with<br>
the other harbor fortifications, and began to put them into a state of<br>
defence. At Pensacola, Fla., Lieutenant Slemmer, by a movement similar<br>
to Anderson's, held Fort Pickens.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The seizure of government property went on through January and February.<br>
In Louisiana all the commissary stores were confiscated, and the revenue<br>
cutter McClelland surrendered. The mint at New Orleans, containing over<br>
half a million in gold and silver, was seized. More than half of the<br>
regular army were stationed in Texas, under General Twiggs. In February,<br>
at the demand of a secessionist committee of public safety, he<br>
surrendered his entire force, together with eighteen military posts. The<br>
troops were sent to a Gulf port and there detained.<br>
<br>
This wholesale seizure of government property, worth some $20,000,000,<br>
has brought down upon the South much scathing rebuke. The conduct of<br>
Floyd, stabbing his country under the cloak of a cabinet office, cannot<br>
be too strongly condemned; but with the seceding States the case was<br>
different. Having (so they thought) established themselves as<br>
independent republics, they could not allow the military works within<br>
their borders to remain in the hands of a foreign power. As to the<br>
Government's property right, they recognized it, and proposed to pay<br>
damages. The provisional constitution of the Confederacy, adopted in<br>
February, provided for negotiations to settle the claim of the United<br>
States.<br>
<br>
The southern leaders were not more anxious to get the slave States out<br>
of the Union than to get them into a grand Southern Confederacy. Early<br>
in January a caucus of secession congressmen was held at Washington, and<br>
arrangements made for a constitutional convention.<br>
<br>
February 4, 1861, delegates from the States which had left the Union met<br>
at Montgomery, Ala., and formed themselves into a provisional Congress.<br>
A temporary government, styled "The Confederate States of America," was<br>
soon organized. Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was chosen President by<br>
the Congress, and Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, Vice-President.<br>
Davis was born in Kentucky in 1808. He graduated at West Point, fought<br>
as colonel in the Mexican war, served three terms as congressman from<br>
Mississippi, the last two in the Senate, and was Secretary of War under<br>
Pierce. After Calhoun's death, in 1850, he became the most prominent of<br>
the ultra southern leaders. The new President was brought from Jackson,<br>
Miss., to Montgomery by a special train, his progress a continual<br>
ovation. Cheering crowds gathered at every station to see and hear him.<br>
February 18th Davis was inaugurated. In his address, which was calm and<br>
moderate in tone, he declared that reunion was now "neither practicable<br>
nor desirable;" he hoped for peace, but said that if the North refused<br>
this, the South must appeal to arms, secure in the blessing of God on a<br>
just cause.<br>
<br>

Jefferson Davis.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Confederate President was intrusted with very large powers,<br>
including supreme control of military affairs. He was authorized to<br>
muster into the service of the central government the regiments which<br>
had been forming in the various States. A call was issued for 100,000<br>
volunteers, and provision made for organizing a regular army. President<br>
Davis appointed a cabinet, with state, treasury, war, navy, and<br>
post-office departments. Robert Toombs, of Georgia, a rabid<br>
secessionist, became Secretary of State.<br>
<br>
March 11th the Confederate Congress adopted a permanent constitution. It<br>
reproduced that of the United States, with some important changes. State<br>
sovereignty was recognized in the preamble, which read, "We, the people<br>
of the Confederate States, each State acting in its sovereign and<br>
independent character," etc. Slavery was called by name, and elaborate<br>
safeguards fixed for it in the States and Territories. Slave-trade from<br>
beyond the sea, or with states not in the Confederacy, was, however,<br>
prohibited. Protective tariffs were absolutely forbidden. The president<br>
and vice-president were to serve six years, and the former could not be<br>
re-elected. Some valuable features were inserted. Members of the cabinet<br>
might discuss matters pertaining to their departments in either house of<br>
congress. The president could veto one part of an appropriation bill<br>
without killing the whole, and was required to lay before the senate his<br>
reasons for the removal of any officers from the civil service.<br>

<br>
<br>
By the last of April all the seceded States had ratified this<br>
constitution. The other slave States were taken in as fast as they<br>
withdrew from the Union. The Southern Confederacy, now fairly launched,<br>
set sail over strange seas upon its short but eventful voyage. At the<br>
start the hopes of those it bore rose high. Few believed that the North<br>
would dare draw sword. Even if it should, the southern heart, proud and<br>
brave, felt sure of victory. King Cotton would win Europe to their side.<br>
Peace would come soon. Visions of a glorious future dazzled the<br>
imaginative mind of the South. A vast slave empire, founded on the<br>
"great physical, philosophical, and moral truth" that slavery is the<br>
"natural condition," of the inferior black race, would spread encircling<br>
arms around the Great Gulf, swallowing up the feeble states of Mexico,<br>
and rise to a wealth and glory unparalleled in the history of nations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
THE NORTH IN THE WINTER OF 1860-61<br>
<br>
[1860-1861]<br>
<br>
At the beginning of the secession movement the North slumbered and<br>
slept. Even South Carolina's withdrawal from the Union caused little<br>
alarm. "She will be glad enough to come back before long," prophesied<br>
many. As the revolution progressed there was a gradual awakening, but<br>
division of opinion paralyzed action. Ultra Abolitionists, with a few<br>
others, urged that the South be let go in peace. Most Republicans<br>
favored the preservation of the Union by force of arms if necessary; but<br>
nearly all Democrats, with many Republicans, wished for compromise. Of<br>
the latter class a few prayed the prodigals to return on their own<br>
terms. More proposed a rigid enforcement of the fugitive slave law, the<br>
repeal of personal liberty legislation, and acquiescence in the Dred<br>
Scott decision, with all future like decrees of the Supreme
Court.&nbsp; This<br>
may be called the northern-democratic position. The most pronounced<br>
Republicans, as Seward and Stanton, would gladly have voted to<br>
re-enforce the Constitution's guarantee to slavery in the slave States.<br>
<br>
Throughout the North the feeling was strong against all efforts at<br>
coercion. Most democratic papers and many republican ones insisted<br>
loudly that use of arms was not to be mentioned, and that the South must<br>
be conciliated. A democratic convention met at Albany in January, to<br>
protest against forcible measures. The sentiment that if force were to<br>
be used it should be "inaugurated at home," here evoked hearty response.<br>
There were signs of even a deeper disaffection. An ex-governor of New<br>
Jersey declared that his State would join the Confederacy. Mayor Wood,<br>
of New York, proposed that if the Union were broken up, his city should<br>
announce herself an independent republic.<br>
<br>
At Washington matters were still worse. President Buchanan, loyal but<br>
weak, feared to lift a finger. In his December message to Congress, he<br>
insisted that a State had no right to secede, but that the United States<br>
had no power to coerce a State which should secede. A majority of his<br>
cabinet were southern men, three of them zealous secessionists. His most<br>
intimate friends in Congress were southerners. These surrounded the<br>
vacillating Chief Magistrate, and paralyzed what little energy was in<br>
him, meanwhile taking advantage of his inaction to launch the<br>
Confederacy. Now and then, spurred on by loyal old General Scott and by<br>
the Union members of his cabinet, the President tried to break away from<br>
the toils which the conspirators had spun around him. The Star of the<br>
West was secretly sent with supplies and recruits to re-enforce Fort<br>
Sumter. But Secretary Thompson warned South Carolina, and when the<br>
vessel arrived off Charleston, January 9th, hostile batteries fired upon<br>
her and forced her out to sea again. Another plan to relieve the fort<br>
was half formed, but came to nothing. Buchanan's term was on the point<br>
of expiring, and he sat supinely looking on while the disruption of the<br>
Union proceeded apace.<br>
<br>
The northern side in Congress showed little wisdom or spirit. Most<br>
northern congressmen truckled to the South or wasted their energies in<br>
fruitless attempts at compromise. Both houses, each by more than a<br>
two-thirds majority, recommended a constitutional amendment depriving<br>
Congress forever of the power to touch slavery in any State without the<br>
consent of all the States. In December the venerable Crittenden, of<br>
Kentucky, laid before the Senate his famous Suggestions for Compromise.<br>
These, besides embodying the above amendment, restored the Missouri<br>
Compromise, let each new State decide for itself whether it would be<br>
slave or free, and forbade Congress to abolish slavery in the District<br>
of Columbia or interfere with the inter-state transportation of slaves.<br>
The United States was to pay for all fugitives whose capture should be<br>
successfully prevented, and slaves as slaves could be carried through<br>
free States. This measure, before Congress all winter, was finally lost<br>
only for lack of southern votes.<br>
<br>
A peace congress, called by Virginia, met at Washington in February.<br>
Most of the northern States were represented and all the southern which<br>
had not seceded. It sat for three weeks, and adopted resolutions<br>
identical in substance with the Crittenden Compromise. These dangerously<br>
large offers of concession, mainly well meant, happily proved useless.<br>
The South had gone too far. She did not want compromise, but was bent<br>
upon setting up a slave empire.<br>
<br>
Mr. Lincoln arrived safely in Washington on February 23d, having eluded<br>
a rumored plot to assassinate him in Baltimore. He accomplished this by<br>
assuming a slight disguise and taking an earlier train than the one in<br>
which he had been announced to go. He was duly inaugurated on March 4th.<br>
In his inaugural he disclaimed all purpose to interfere with slavery in<br>
the slave States, yet denied the right of secession, and proposed to<br>
regain and hold the property and places belonging to the United States<br>
in all parts thereof. There would be no bloodshed, he said, unless it<br>
were forced upon the Government. "In your hands, my dissatisfied<br>
fellow-countrymen," so ran his memorable words, "in your hands, not in<br>
mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. You can have no conflict<br>
without being yourselves the aggressors. We are not enemies, but<br>
friends." This message, held out as an olive branch, the South denounced<br>
as a menace. Some northern papers condemned it as the "knell and requiem<br>
of the Union." But the general feeling it evoked at the North was one of<br>
rejoicing. People believed that a hand both moderate and firm had at<br>
length seized the helm.<br>
<br>
The new President stood faced by an herculean task. Congress was not yet<br>
fully purged of traitors, while Washington still swarmed with their<br>
friends and agents. Floyd's treachery had tied Lincoln's hands. All the<br>
best munitions of war had been sent south. Of the rifled cannon<br>
belonging to the United States not one was left. Only a handful of<br>
regular troops were within call, and the resignations of their officers<br>
came in daily. The plight of the navy and treasury was no better.<br>
Amazing coolness and the absurd prejudice against coercing States<br>
largely possessed even the loyal masses. The attack on Sumter was thus a<br>
god-send.<br>
<br>
April 8th, Governor Pickens received notice from President Lincoln that<br>
an attempt would be made to provision that fort. Thereupon General<br>
Beauregard, who had left the United States army to take charge of the<br>
fortifications at Charleston, was ordered by President Davis to demand<br>
its evacuation. Major Anderson replied that they should be starved out<br>
by the 15th, and would leave the fort then unless his Government sent<br>
supplies. This answer was held unsatisfactory, and at 3.20 on the<br>
morning of April 12th Beauregard notified Anderson that his batteries<br>
would open fire in one hour.<br>
<br>
Fort Sumter stood on an artificial island at the entrance of the harbor.<br>
It was pentagonal in shape, the walls of brick, eight feet thick and<br>
forty feet high. The parapet was pierced for 140 guns, but only 48 were<br>
in condition for use. The garrison, including some 40 workmen and a<br>
band, numbered 128. Surrounding the fort on all sides except toward the<br>
sea, and distant from 1,300 to 2,500 yards, 19 Confederate batteries<br>
were in position, mounting 47 cannon and mortars, and manned by 3,000 or<br>
4,000 volunteers. These works were provided with bomb-proofs made of<br>
railroad iron or of palmetto logs and sand.<br>
<br>
The wharves, roofs, and steeples of Charleston were black with expectant<br>
crowds, straining their eyes down the harbor where the silent castle<br>
loomed up through the dim morning light. Boom! From a mortar battery to<br>
the south a bombshell rises high into the air, describes its graceful<br>
trajectory and falls within Sumter's enclosure. It is the signal gun.<br>
One battery after another responds, until in less than an hour the<br>
stronghold is girt by an almost continuous circle of flashing artillery.<br>
Shells scream through the air and explode above the doomed work, and<br>
great cannon-balls bury themselves in the brick walls. Still Sumter<br>
speaks not. Anderson is waiting for daylight. About six o'clock he<br>
breakfasts his garrison on pork and water, the only provisions left. An<br>
hour later the embrasures are opened, the black guns run out, and Sumter<br>
hurls back her answer to the voice of rebellion. The bombs making it<br>
unsafe to use the barbette cannons of the open rampart, Anderson was<br>
confined to his twenty-one casemate pieces, mostly of light calibre. The<br>
fire was kept up briskly all the morning. Sumter stood it well, but did<br>
little damage to the opposing batteries. At sunset the guns of both<br>
sides became silent, but the mortars maintained a slow fire through the<br>
night.<br>
<br>
Early next morning the cannonade opened afresh, and in the course of the<br>
forenoon hot shot set fire to Sumter's wooden barracks. The flames soon<br>
got beyond control; the powder magazine had to be closed; and the heat<br>
and smoke became so stifling that the garrison was forced, in order to<br>
avoid suffocation, to lie face downward upon the floor, each man with a<br>
wet cloth at his mouth. Powder was at last exhausted. About one o'clock<br>
the flag was shot away. It was immediately raised again upon a low<br>
jury-mast, but could not be seen for the smoke, and Beauregard sent to<br>
ask if Anderson had surrendered. The latter offered to evacuate upon the<br>
terms named before the bombardment, to which Beauregard agreed, and all<br>
firing ceased. The next day at noon, after a salute of fifty guns to<br>
their flag, Major Anderson and his men evacuated the scene of their<br>
heroism, and soon after took passage for New York.<br>
<br>
The disunion leaders had rightly calculated that an open blow would<br>
bring the border slave States into the Confederacy; but they had not<br>
anticipated the effect of such a deed beyond Mason and Dixon's line.<br>
When it was known that the old flag had been fired upon, a thrill of<br>
passionate rage electrified the North from Maine to Oregon. Then was<br>
witnessed an uprising unparalleled in our history if not in that of<br>
mankind. From every city, town, and hamlet, loud and earnest came the<br>
call, "The Union must be preserved! Away with compromise! Away with<br>
further attempts to conciliate traitors! To arms!" Slavery might do all<br>
else, so little did most northerners yet feel its evil, but it could not<br>
rend the Union. Pulpit, platform, and press echoed with patriotic cries.<br>
Everywhere were Union meetings, speeches, and parades. Union badges<br>
decked everyone's clothing, and the Stars and Stripes were kept unfurled<br>
as only on national holidays before. In New York City a mass-meeting of<br>
two hundred thousand declared for war. The New York Herald changed its<br>
sneer to a war-blast. Party lines were thrown down. Democrats like<br>
Butler, Cass, and Dickinson were in the Union van. Senator Douglas,<br>
lately Lincoln's antagonist, and at first strongly opposed to coercion,<br>
went through the West arousing the people by his patriotic eloquence.<br>
"There can be no neutrals now," were his words, "only patriots and<br>
traitors."<br>

Route of the Sixth Massachusetts Troops through
Baltimore.]<br>
<br>
<br>
April 15th, President Lincoln issued a call for seventy-five thousand<br>
volunteers, and each free State responded with twice its quota.<br>
Enlisting offices were opened in every town and hamlet, and the roll of<br>
the drum and the tramp of armed men with faces set southward were heard<br>
all over the North. First to march was the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment.<br>
Forming on Boston Common it took cars for Washington on April 17th,<br>
reaching Baltimore on the morning of the 19th.<br>
<br>
Maryland was trembling in the balance between Union and disunion. A<br>
determined disunionist minority was working with might and main to drag<br>
the State into secession. Baltimore was white-hot with southern zeal,<br>
determined that the Bay State troops should never reach Washington<br>
through that metropolis. Eight of the cars containing the soldiers were<br>
drawn safely across the city. The next was assailed by a hooting mob,<br>
and the windows smashed in by bricks and paving stones. Some of the<br>
soldiers were wounded by pistol shots, and a scattering fire was<br>
returned. Sand, stones, anchors, and other obstructions were heaped upon<br>
the track. The remaining four companies therefore left the cars and<br>
started to march. They soon met the mob, flying a secession flag. A<br>
melee ensued. The troops moved double-quick toward the Washington depot,<br>
surrounded by a seething mass of infuriated secessionists filling the<br>
air with their brick-bats and stones, while bullets whizzed from<br>
sidewalks and windows. The troops returned the fire, and several in the<br>
crowd fell. The chief of police with fifty officers appeared on the<br>
scene, who, by presenting cocked revolvers, held the rioters in check<br>
for a while, till the distressed troops could join their comrades.<br>
Baltimore was in the hands of this secessionist band for the rest of the<br>
day. The bridges north of that city were also burned, so that no more<br>
troops could reach Washington by this route.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the capital city was in great peril, devotees of the South<br>
being each moment expected to make an attack upon it. Only fifteen<br>
companies of local militia and six of regulars were present at<br>
inauguration time, stationed by General Scott at critical points in the<br>
city. Pickets were posted continually on roads and bridges outside. Four<br>
hundred Pennsylvania troops happily arrived on April 18th, and the next<br>
day came the Sixth Massachusetts. But the city was not yet secure. There<br>
were reports that large bodies of men were gathering in Maryland and<br>
Virginia for a descent upon it. Washington was put in a state of siege,<br>
the public buildings barricaded and provided with sentinels. The<br>
Government seized the Potomac steamers and also all the flour within<br>
reach. Business ceased. Alarmed by rumors of a military impressment,<br>
hundreds of government clerks, besides officers in the army and navy,<br>
came out in their true colors and fled south. Enemies at Baltimore had<br>
cut off telegraphic communication between Washington and the North.<br>
Reports came that re-enforcements were on the way, but day followed day<br>
without witnessing their arrival. The President and all Unionists were<br>
in an agony of suspense.<br>

On April 22d the Eighth Massachusetts, under General B. F. Butler, and<br>
the famous Seventh Regiment from New York City, met at Annapolis. Here<br>
they were delayed several days. Governor Hicks had warned them not to<br>
land on Maryland soil. The railroad to Washington had been torn up for<br>
many miles and the engines damaged. Among his troops Butler found the<br>
very machinists who had made the engines. Repairs were promptly<br>
effected, the track re-laid, and about noon of the 25th the gallant New<br>
Yorkers landed in Washington amid the joyful shouts of the loyal<br>
populace. Up Pennsylvania Avenue swept the solid ranks, bands playing<br>
and colors flying, to gladden the heart of the careworn President as he<br>
welcomed them at the White House. A sudden change came over the city.<br>
Secessionists slunk away, the faces of the loyal beamed with joy. The<br>
national capital was safe.<br>

CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
WAR BEGUN<br>
<br>
[1861]<br>
<br>
It was now apparent to both North and South that war was inevitable. Yet<br>
neither side believed the other in full earnest or dreamed of a long<br>
struggle. Sanguine northerners looked to see the rebellion stamped out<br>
in thirty days. The more cautious allowed three months.<br>
<br>
The President, however, soon saw that more troops, enlisted for a longer<br>
term, would be necessary. At the outset the South certainly possessed<br>
decided advantages: greater earnestness, more men of leisure aching for<br>
war and accustomed to saddle and firearms, a militia better organized,<br>
owing to fear of slave insurrections, and now for a long time in special<br>
training, and withal a certain soldierly fire and dash native to the<br>
people. The South also had superior arms. Enlistments there were prompt<br>
and abundant. The troops were ably commanded, 262 of the 951 regular<br>
army officers whom secession found in service, including many very high<br>
in rank, joining their States in the new cause, besides a large number<br>
of West Point graduates from civil life.<br>
<br>
Accordingly on May 3d Mr. Lincoln issued a new call for troops, 42,000<br>
volunteers to serve three years or during the war, 23,000 regulars, and<br>
18,000 seamen. It was of first importance to secure Maryland for the<br>
Union. On the night of May 13th, under cover of a thunderstorm, General<br>
Butler suddenly entered rebellious Baltimore with less than 1,000 men,<br>
and entrenched upon Federal Hill. Overawed by this bold move, the<br>
secessionists made no resistance. A political reaction soon set in<br>
throughout the State, which became firmly Unionist. Baltimore was once<br>
more open to the passage of troops, who kept steadily hurrying to the<br>
front.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the Confederate forces were getting uncomfortably close to<br>
Washington. From the White House a secession flag could be seen flying<br>
at Alexandria, which was occupied by a small pro-secession garrison.<br>
There was fear lest that party would occupy Arlington Heights, across<br>
from Washington, and thence pour shot and shell into the city. At two<br>
o'clock on the morning of May 24th, eight regiments crossed the Potomac<br>
and took possession of these hills as far south as Alexandria, and<br>
fortified them. The latter place was entered by Colonel Ellsworth with<br>
his famous New York Zouaves. No resistance was made, as the Confederates<br>
had retired, but Ellsworth was brutally assassinated while hauling down<br>
the secession flag.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 338px; height: 406px;" alt=""

Captain Nathaniel Lyon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Upon the secession of Virginia the Confederate capital was removed to<br>
Richmond. The main armies of both sides were now encamped on Old<br>
Dominion soil, and at no great distance apart; but the commanders were<br>
busy drilling their raw troops, so that for a time only trifling<br>
engagements occurred. General Butler, with a considerable body of men,<br>
was occupying Fortress Monroe, at the mouth of the James River. June<br>
10th, an expedition sent by him against the Confederates at Big Bethel,<br>
some twelve miles distant, was repulsed after a spirited attack, with a<br>
total loss of sixty-eight. A week later an Ohio regiment took the cars<br>
to make a reconnoissance toward Vienna, a village not far south of<br>
Washington. They were surprised by Confederates, who placed two guns on<br>
the track and fired on the train as it came around a curve. The Ohioans<br>
sprang to the ground, and after some fighting drove their opponents<br>
back.<br>
<br>
All this time both North and South were struggling for possession of the<br>
neutral States. Governor Jackson, of Missouri, was straining every nerve<br>
to force his State into secession. Early in May two or three regiments<br>
of militia were got together and drilled in a camp near St. Louis.<br>
Cannon were sent by President Davis, boxed up and marked "marble."<br>
Captain Lyon, of the regular army, who held the St. Louis arsenal with a<br>
few companies, reconnoitred the secessionist camp in female dress. The<br>
next day, May 10th, assisted by local militia, he suddenly surrounded it<br>
and took 1,200 prisoners. A month later he embarked some soldiers on<br>
three swift steamers, sailed up the Missouri to Jefferson City, the<br>
state capital, and raised the Union flag once more over the State House.<br>
Governor Jackson fled. During the next month all the armed disunionists<br>
were driven into the southwestern part of the State.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 342px; height: 431px;" alt=""
 src="images/348Pic.jpg"><br>
General John C. Fremont.<br>
<br>
<br>
The last of July a state convention organized a provisional government<br>
and declared for the Union. But the secessionists, under General Price,<br>
continued the struggle. The Union forces, after a brave fight against<br>
great odds at Wilson's Creek, August 10th, in which Lyon was killed, had<br>
to retreat north. General Fremont had shortly before been put at the<br>
head of the Western Department, which included Missouri, Kentucky,<br>
Illinois, and Kansas. His difficulties were great. He was unable to<br>
clear the State of secessionists, who besieged Lexington and took it on<br>
September 20th. Generals Hunter and Halleck, Fremont's successors, were<br>
equally unsuccessful, and the State was harassed by a petty warfare all<br>
the year.<br>
<br>
In Kentucky, Governor Magoffin was inclined to secession. The<br>
Legislature leaned the other way, but preferred neutrality to active<br>
participation on either side. September 6th, Brigadier-General U. S.<br>
Grant occupied Paducah, an important strategical point at the junction<br>
of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers. Next day the Confederate General Polk,<br>
advancing from below, took possession of Columbus on the Mississippi.<br>
With both hostile armies thus encamped on her soil, Kentucky could no<br>
longer be neutral. Her decision was quickly taken. The Legislature<br>
demanded of President Davis to withdraw Polk's forces, at the same time<br>
calling upon General Anderson, the hero of Sumter, who had been placed<br>
in charge of the Department of the Cumberland, to take active measures<br>
for the defence of this his native State.<br>
<br>
The mountain portion of Virginia belonged to the West rather than to the<br>
South. It contained only 18,000 slaves, against nearly 500,000 in<br>
Eastern Virginia. Union sentiment was therefore strong, and when the old<br>
State seceded from the Union, Western Virginia proceeded to secede from<br>
the State. General Lee sent troops to hold it for the Confederacy.<br>
Thereupon General McClellan, commanding the Department of the Ohio,<br>
threw several regiments across the river into Virginia, and defeated the<br>
foe in minor engagements at Philippi, Rich Mountain, and Carrick's Ford.<br>
By the middle of July he was able to report, "Secession is killed in<br>
this country." Later in the year the Confederates renewed their<br>
attempts, but were finally driven out. West Virginia organized a<br>
separate government, and was subsequently admitted to the Union as a<br>
State by itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 487px; height: 516px;" alt="" src="images/351Pic.jpg"><br>
Bull Run--the Field of Strategy.<br>
<br>
<br>
While these struggles were going on in the border commonwealths, the<br>
Union soldiers lay inactive along the Potomac. Constant drill had<br>
changed the mob into some semblance of an organized army, but the<br>
careful Scott feared to risk a general engagement. The hostile forces<br>
stretched in three pairs of groups across Virginia from northwest to<br>
southeast. In the southeastern part of the State, at Fortress Monroe,<br>
Butler faced the Confederate Magruder. At Manassas, opposite Washington,<br>
and about thirty miles southwest, lay a Confederate army under General<br>
Beauregard. General Patterson, a veteran of the War of 1812, commanded<br>
considerable forces in Southern Pennsylvania. About the middle of June<br>
he advanced against Harper's Ferry, which had been abandoned by the<br>
Unionists the latter part of April and was now occupied by General<br>
Joseph E. Johnston. Johnston evacuated the place upon Patterson's<br>
approach, and retreated up the Shenandoah Valley, in a southwesterly<br>
direction, to Winchester. Patterson followed part way, and the two<br>
armies now lay watching each other.<br>
<br>
Anxious to see the rebellion put down by one blow, the North was<br>
becoming impatient. "On to Richmond!" was the ceaseless cry. Yielding to<br>
this, Scott ordered an advance. July 16th, General McDowell, leaving one<br>
division to protect Washington, led forth an army 28,000 strong to<br>
attack the enemy at Manassas. He advanced slowly and with great caution.<br>
The enemy were found posted in a line eight miles long upon the south<br>
bank of Bull Run, a small river three miles east of Manassas, running in<br>
a southeasterly direction. Several days were spent in reconnoitering.<br>
Meanwhile, Johnston, whom Patterson was expected to hold at Winchester,<br>
had stolen away to join Beauregard, their combined forces numbering<br>
about 30,000. McDowell was ignorant of Johnston's movement, supposing<br>
him still at Winchester.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 294px; height: 351px;" alt=""
 src="images/353Pic.jpg"><br>
General Irvin McDowell.<br>
<br>
<br>
On the morning of the 21st McDowell advanced to the attack. Beauregard<br>
held all the lower fords, besides a stone bridge on the Warrenton<br>
turnpike which crosses the river at right angles. Two divisions, under<br>
Hunter and Heintzelman, were set in motion before sunrise to make a<br>
flanking detour and cross Bull Run at Sudley's Ford, some distance<br>
farther up. To distract attention from this movement, Tyler's division<br>
began an attack at the stone bridge. This was held by a regiment and a<br>
half, with four guns, under General Evans. He replied vigorously at<br>
first, but perceiving after a while that Tyler was only feigning, and<br>
learning of the flank movement above, he left four companies at the<br>
bridge and drew up the rest of his forces on a ridge north of Warrenton<br>
turnpike to await Hunter and Heintzelman's approach down the Sudley<br>
road.<br>
<br>

General Samuel P. Heintzelman.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fight began about ten o'clock. Both sides were soon re-enforced.<br>
After two hours' stubborn fighting the Confederates were driven back<br>
across the pike, beyond Young's Branch of Bull Run, and took up a second<br>
position on a hill each side of the Henry House. The whole Union force<br>
had now crossed Bull Run. Griffin's and Ricketts' powerful batteries<br>
were posted in favorable positions, whence they poured a deadly fire<br>
upon the Confederates. The whole Union line advanced to the turnpike.<br>
About two o'clock the Confederates were forced to abandon their second<br>
position and fall back still farther.<br>
<br>
Early in the morning Beauregard and Johnston had given orders for an<br>
attack upon the Union forces across the river, not knowing that McDowell<br>
had assumed the offensive. These orders were now countermanded, and all<br>
available troops hurried up the Sudley road toward the Warrenton pike<br>
front. Till after noon the prospect for the Confederates looked gloomy.<br>
They had been steadily driven back. Some of their regiments had lost<br>
heavily, while all were more or less demoralized. Johnston and<br>
Beauregard gave their personal direction to re-forming the line upon a<br>
second ridge to the south of the Warrenton pike, under cover of a<br>
semicircular piece of woods. Twelve regiments, with twenty-two guns and<br>
two companies of cavalry, concentrated in this favorable position and<br>
awaited the Union advance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 453px; height: 452px;" alt=""
 src="images/357Pic.jpg"><br>
Bull Run-Battle of the Forenoon.<br>
<br>
<br>
McDowell had fourteen regiments available for the attack. He decided to<br>
hurl them against the Confederate centre and left. About half-past two<br>
Griffin's and Ricketts' batteries took up an advanced position on Henry<br>
Hill. The Confederate guns opened fire, and a short artillery duel took<br>
place. A Confederate regiment now advances to capture the exposed<br>
batteries. They are mistaken for Union re-enforcements and allowed to<br>
come within close range. The muskets are levelled. A terrible volley is<br>
poured into the batteries. The gunners are stricken down. The frantic<br>
horses dash madly down the hill. After a little confusion the Union<br>
troops boldly advance and retake the batteries. The battle surges back<br>
and forth. The guns are three times captured and lost again. The fight<br>
becomes general along the Confederate centre and left. The Union<br>
generals are getting alarmed. So far they have been confident of<br>
victory. Now regiment after regiment is going to pieces in this terrific<br>
melee, and still the "rebels" hold their ground. About half-past four<br>
o'clock General Early arrives by rail with three thousand more of<br>
Johnston's army, and, assisted by a battery and five companies of<br>
cavalry, bursts upon the extreme right flank and rear of McDowell's<br>
line.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 486px; height: 495px;" alt="" src="images/359Pic.jpg"><br>
Bull Run--Battle of the Afternoon.<br>
<br>
<br>
This manoeuvre decided the day. The Union ranks waver, break, flee. The<br>
centre and left soon follow, though in better order. Union and<br>
Confederate generals alike were astonished at the sudden change.<br>
McDowell found it impossible to stem the tide once set in, and gave<br>
orders to fall back across Bull Run to Centreville, where his reserves<br>
were stationed. As the retreat went on it turned to a downright rout.<br>
The Confederates made only a feeble pursuit, but fear of pursuit spread<br>
alarm through the flying ranks, demoralized by long marching and hard<br>
fighting. Baggage and ammunition-wagons, ambulances, private vehicles<br>
which had been standing in the rear, joined the sweeping tide, adding to<br>
the confusion and in some places causing temporary blockade. Frightened<br>
teamsters cut traces and galloped recklessly away. Panic and stampede<br>
resulted, soon reaching the soldiers. Flinging away muskets and<br>
knapsacks, they sought safety in flight. The army entered Centreville a<br>
disorganized mass. Fugitives could not be stayed even there, but<br>
streamed through and on toward Washington. McDowell gave the order to<br>
continue the retreat. The reserve brigades, with the one regiment of<br>
regulars, covered the rear in good order. All that night the crazy<br>
hustle to the rear was kept up, and on Monday the hungry and exhausted<br>
stragglers poured into Washington under a drizzling rain, the people<br>
receiving them with heavy hearts but generous hands.<br>
<br>
<br>

General Joseph E. Johnston.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Union loss was 481 killed, 1,011 wounded, 1,460 prisoners.<br>
Twenty-five guns were lost, thirteen of them on the retreat. The<br>
Confederate loss was 387 killed, 1,580 wounded. The numbers actively<br>
engaged were about 18,000 on each side. General Sherman pronounced Bull<br>
Run "one of the best planned battles of the war, but one of the worst<br>
fought." The latter fact was but natural. The troops on both sides were<br>
poorly drilled, and most of them had never been under fire before.<br>
Precision of movement, concert of action on any large scale, were<br>
impossible. Neither side needed to be ashamed of this initial trial.<br>
<br>
The North was at first much cast down. The faint-hearted considered the<br>
Union hopelessly lost, but pluck and patriotism carried the day. On the<br>
morrow after the battle Congress voted that an army of 500,000 should be<br>
raised, and appropriated $500,000,000 to carry on the war. General<br>
McClellan, whose brilliant campaign in West Virginia had won him easy<br>
fame, was put in command of the Army of the Potomac. The young general<br>
was a West Point graduate and had served with distinction in the Mexican<br>
War. An accomplished military student, a skilful engineer, and a superb<br>
organizer, he threw himself with energy into the task of fortifying<br>
Washington and building up a splendid army. Many of the three-months<br>
volunteers re-enlisted. Thousands of new recruits came flocking to camp,<br>
and before long companies, regiments, and brigades amounting to 150,000<br>
men were drilling daily on the banks of the Potomac, while formidable<br>
works crowned the entire crest of Arlington Heights. In October the aged<br>
General Scott resigned, and McClellan, at the summit of his popularity<br>
with army and people, became commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 327px; height: 378px;" alt=""
 src="images/363Pic.jpg"><br>
General George B. McClellan.<br>
<br>
<br>
For several weeks after Bull Run it was feared that Beauregard and his<br>
men would descend upon Washington, then in a defenceless condition; but<br>
they were in no state to attack. They too felt the need of preparation<br>
for the coming struggle, whose magnitude both sides now began to<br>
realize.<br>
<br>
A disheartening affair occurred in October. On the night of the 20th two<br>
Massachusetts regiments crossed the Potomac at Ball's Bluff, a few miles<br>
above Washington, to surprise a hostile camp which according to rumor<br>
had been established there. A large force concealed in the woods<br>
attacked and forced them to retreat. They were re-enforced by 1,900 men<br>
under Colonel Baker. The enemy were also re-enforced. Baker was killed<br>
and the Union soldiers driven over the bluff into the river. The boats<br>
were totally inadequate in number, and the men had to make their way<br>
across as best they could, exposed to the Confederate fire. The total<br>
Union loss was 1,000.<br>
<br>
On the whole, then, the South had reason to be gratified with the<br>
aggregate result of the first year of war. Bull Run gave the<br>
Confederates a sense of invincibility, and the ready recognition by the<br>
foreign powers of their rights as belligerents, offered hope that<br>
England would soon acknowledge their independence itself. And they<br>
